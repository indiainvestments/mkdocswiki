# How to link FAQ via bot in Discord

## Intro üçÅ

As a community of investors, we get queries from time to time, that are frequently asked. Often repeatedly.

We have FAQs on our wiki, for queries such as these, that addresses such queries. But having it in an archive is of no value, if it cannot be searched and linked, as and when needed.

We've a setup that solves this problem - any active member can invoke the bot with a specific tag, and the bot would take care of presenting right information to the user.

We'll explore next how to invoke this bot

## List of Tags üìö

We use Carl-bot's tag feature at present to achieve this.

Every time a new FAQ entry is created, it gets a corresponding `tag` entry for Carl bot.

List of all available tag-based triggers can be found by typing `.taglist` in `#test` channel in our Discord.

Once this message is typed, Carl-bot would DM you the list of available tags.

![Sample message sent by bot - Light mode](/images/bot-dm-taglist.light%20(1).png){.light-mode-image}

Above image(s) are illustrative. Actual list can be different, and change from time to time. For latest updated list, you can use `.taglist` in `#test` channel.

## Table of tags üèì

Below are the exhaustive list of all tags, what kind of typical query / comment should someone ask to get that as response, and the expected response from bot .

Just because we discuss a specific stock, or bond, or mutual fund, or even any investment apps in our wiki; doesn't mean we're recommending those.

It‚Äôs rare for markets to move up / down so much in a single month, that a single SIP installment being on a different date would make a size-able difference in your long term. Read [more here](https://indiainvestments.gitbook.io/content/faqs/which-date-s-is-are-best-for-sip-in-a-month)                                |

| `.chit`         | *Should I invest in a chit fund?*, *What kind of returns can I expect from a chit?*                           | Hey `@user`, we have some discussions on chit funds [here](https://indiainvestments.gitbook.io/content/faqs/explain-like-i-am-5-eli5-chit-funds.). If you have more queries about chit funds, you can ask in #general-talk after reading this :)                                                                                                                             |

And if the investment principal is small, the return difference wouldn‚Äôt be large. Just pick one, you‚Äôre as likely to be wrong as you could be lucky.

You‚Äôd be left with peanuts. It‚Äôs one of the most opaque forms of investment, and there‚Äôs no guarantee. Govt. backs LIC, not your financial future.

Insurance companies and bank RMs would make gains, but you could do much better not mixing insurance with investments. Insurance cover is inadequate, returns from ULIPs are lower than bank deposits.

## Prerequisites ‚úã

We expect you to familiarize yourself with all the FAQs, before starting with this.

You can go through our FAQs using below link

{% content-ref url="../faqs/index.md" %}
[index.md](../faqs/index.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

If you're using the bot to invoke the FAQ, it's expected that you've yourself at the very least gone through that FAQ first.
