# General Style Guide

## Intro üëã

This document should serve as a standard guideline on how to write for [r/IndiaInvestments](https://reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments) wiki.

There‚Äôs no *one true* way of writing it. But when working on a collaborative project such as this, we all should agree with certain ground rules, to have uniform content throughout our knowledge base.

It also helps reviewers, reducing cognitive load on what to watch out for.

Following points are meant as a way to help you form an article from scratch. We can then tweak it later, based on review feedback.

## Tone üéµ

It should have a balanced tone. No need to be overly aggressive / abusive / cocky / snarky. Simultaneously, avoid being overly cute or too nice. Basically, avoid emotional hot-takes, or controversial flame-baits.

Standard text, with somewhat firmness is well suited. Write less. Break complex sentences down to simpler ones. Use periods more than conjunctions.

Avoid phrases like *in my humble opinion* (you‚Äôre writing it, of course it‚Äôs in your opinion. Duh!), or *correct me if I‚Äôm wrong*, or *I‚Äôm no lawyer*. Similarly, avoid raining emojis.

Furnish information that you can, and avoid taking the note in a direction that you‚Äôre not comfortable with.

In particular, avoid passive mode wherever possible. Sure, it‚Äôs not always avoidable - sometimes a sentence may even have no other choice but to omit the subject.

But for most scenarios, active voice is better suited.

## Wall of text üß±

Reading a *large wall of text* can be unsettling, and boring.

Strive to not have paragraphs **more than 1-2 sentences long**. If you‚Äôre writing a paragraph that‚Äôs more than three sentences long, you‚Äôre doing something wrong.

We‚Äôre not looking for dense academic dissertations.

## Acronyms and Short-form Abbreviations üîπ

We‚Äôd often be referring to terms that are used in short-form or as acronyms.

If you introduce a new acronym in a chapter that‚Äôs not covered before, feel free to expand on that in a sentence. At the very least, provide the full-form once (and only once), before using the acronym everywhere else.

This is one example of how **not** to do acronyms in the wiki:

*CDSL is one of the depositories that would send you a CAS every month*

**CDSL**, **CAS** - these two terms would alienate the reader. Because they might not know what these are, if you‚Äôve not introduced these in context.

We fall back to our guiding principle - you shouldn‚Äôt make assumptions about what the reader already knows. Instead, accept it upfront that they probably don‚Äôt know, err on the side of repetition.

This is a better way of writing the same sentence from above:

*CDSL (**C**entral **D**epository **S**ervices **L**imited) is one of the depositories that would send you a CAS (**C**onsolidated **A**ccount **S**tatement) every month*.

Once you introduce an acronym or abbreviation with its full-form, you can use the acronym in that document / page etc.; without having to repeat the full-form again.

Above is one example. One could have the acronym in the parenthesis instead, and full-form preceding that.

***C**entral **D**epository **S**ervices **L**imited (CDSL) is one of the depositories that would send you a **C**onsolidated **A**ccount **S**tatement (CAS) every month.*

But it should be present. At least once, and exactly once.

**Do not** provide full-form of obvious and well-known acronyms, only the ones that are specific to investing / finance / economics domain.

For example, there‚Äôs no need to write it like this:

*US (**U**nited **S**tates) equities are less correlated with Indian equities, than Indian equity mutual funds*.

It isn‚Äôt unreasonable to expect that a reader would be familiar with the acronym `US`.

## Be unbiased ‚òØÔ∏è

A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself this: *if someone reads this 5 years from now, how much change would this text need to remain relevant?*

Focus on producing *evergreen* content.

For example, you might be tempted to write *Product X is not right for you, it doesn‚Äôt even have feature Y*.

Except, five years from now, it might. Or, maybe this feature Y won‚Äôt even be needed five years down the line.

A better sentence would be *At the time of writing this, product X doesn‚Äôt support Y. You may consider it if that changes*.

Avoid opinions. It‚Äôs okay to say *historically equity has beaten inflation over the long term, at least in the last 40 years.*

But it‚Äôs not okay to phrase it as *equity is the only asset that‚Äôd perform better than inflation*.

No one can predict that.

## Linking to external resources üåè

In course of creating a content, you‚Äôd be tempted to link to an external resource - some blog post, news articles, videos, other community posts from Reddit / Valuepickr / TradingQnA etc.

**Don‚Äôt**.

At least not directly to that resource.

Links can be taken down / removed / made inaccessible. As much as possible, from the beginning, we‚Äôve taken steps to not let that happen.

Ideally, we‚Äôd want to link to Internet Archive‚Äôs archived version of that link. [Wikipedia was able to restore nearly 9 million dead links with this](https://blog.archive.org/2018/10/01/more-than-9-million-broken-links-on-wikipedia-are-now-rescued/). Google web-cache can also be used.

Here‚Äôs how a sample link to CNN‚Äôs coverage of Buffet‚Äôs Annual Shareholder letter of 2021 might look like:

[Real Link](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/27/investing/warren-buffett-annual-letter/index.html) \| [archive.org link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301184753/https://edition.cnn.com/2021/02/27/investing/warren-buffett-annual-letter/index.html) \| [archive.is link](https://archive.is/nnPAV).

Take this tweet from NSE India official twitter handle: <https://twitter.com/NSEIndia/status/1366251518999977984>. This is a status update communication regarding system downtime at NSE.

We can reasonably expect for this link to stay up. However, just to be safe, add these links as well.

[Link to actual tweet](https://twitter.com/NSEIndia/status/1366251518999977984) \| [archive.org link](https://web.archive.org/web/20210301045907/https://twitter.com/NSEIndia/status/1366251518999977984) \| [archive.is link](https://archive.is/9ceKG)

You could use Internet Archive‚Äôs Wayback machine to search for a latest archived version yourself.

Alternatively, you could use these extensions / plugins in your browsers, to get the archived versions:

-   [Firefox Web Archive](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/view-page-archive/)
-   [Chrome Web Archives](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-archives/hkligngkgcpcolhcnkgccglchdafcnao)

### Reddit links ‚öì

When it comes to Reddit links, especially links to a comment or post; we‚Äôve decided to provide four links, instead of three.

Reddit is a social platform, with multiple clients and readers out there, which aid users across the world consume its content. Aside from the *new.reddit* and *old.reddit* web platforms; Reddit also have plethora of mobile clients - Joey, Apollo, and many others; aside from the official Reddit app.

To allow users to continue consuming the content from Reddit on their choice of client / reader service, we need to provide these three or four links:

[www.reddit link](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/dnemrb/norway_pension_fund_a_1t_fund_for_people_of_norway/) \| [old.reddit link](https://old.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/dnemrb/norway_pension_fund_a_1t_fund_for_people_of_norway/) \| [archive.is link](https://archive.is/GXPB1)

The first link with `www` subdomain, allows readers to open it in their favorite Reddit clients. Second link allows good number of *Redditors*, who still prefer the older UI (because it renders all comments in a simple HTML, and not just top comments in a thread), easily consume the content.

## Miscellaneous ü¶ã

-   Avoid referring to yourself in first person. *I*, *me*, *we*, *present author* etc. pronouns / phrases are best avoided.

-   Keep asking yourself *who‚Äôs the intended reader for this?* For instance, if you‚Äôre writing chapter 5 of a series, then you can reasonably assume the reader would be well-versed in content entries from previous four chapters of the same series. No need to repeat any concept already covered in first four chapters preceding that. However, if the content is not something a reader is supposed to know, it‚Äôs best if you explain in 2-3 sentences. Make the content as *beginner friendly* as possible, without compromising quality. To that end, use examples to illustrate a concept. Or, use diagrams (tools like Excalidraw can help with this), or tables, or even images or videos. Beginner friendly coverage of concepts are comprehensive. If you write a specific concept once, so anyone who didn‚Äôt understand that before can now grasp it reading that content - it benefits every other contributor out there. Because they can simply refer to that in their writing, without having to covering same concept.  

-   No plagiarism

    If you have read an online article or blog post whose content you wish to use, read & understand it first; then write in your own language. Also credit the original source.

    You can quote a source, as long as you cite it properly.

    But copy-pasting verbatim from a source and trying to pass it off as your own work would invite troubles for you. We do this check before inserting every piece of content into the wiki. And it‚Äôs surprisingly easy to discover when someone copies even a single paragraph from external sources.

-   After writing an entry, **read it yourself**, before you ask others to review it.

    That alone would help you catch common errors or issues with it, before others even need to review it.

## Wrapping Up

Most of us are pretty average at most things we do. Even if you‚Äôre exceptional at one thing, chances are that you‚Äôre average, or below average, at most other things. That‚Äôs just the nature of life. To become truly great at something, you have to dedicate tons of time and energy to it.

We all have limited time and energy, and most of us choose to devote it to our fields of choice. It is then perfectly understandable a lot of us, most of us, are not good at parts of content writing, like phrasing and structuring sentences, even if we have valuable content to share with others.

When we offer help with these parts, trust us when we say it‚Äôs not because our intents are to put someone down, or *establish a sense of superiority complex*, it is pure and simple help, because it would be very presumptuous of us to assume all content contributors are good at content writing.

However, this is being built as a free open-source project. If you don‚Äôt agree with our choices; you can fork the project on GitHub, and maintain your own version of the wiki.

In the next few sections, we cover dedicated guides as to specific series or sections of the wiki.
