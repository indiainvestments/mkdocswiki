# How to rematerialize mutual fund from demat form

### Intro üí´ <a id="Intro"></a>

There can be some disadvantages and inconveniences for having the mutual funds in *dematerialized* (aka demat) form.

Some of these are

1.  Difficult to change the investment platform or DP (**D**epository **P**articipant)
2.  Vendor lock-in, where you are locked to the brokerage platform and its subset of functionalities.
3.  You will have to pay various charges like annual charges, depository charges etc.

???+ info
    Often, you might find it more cost effective to sell your demat holdings through your broker, and re-buy units in non-demat mode in same fund's direct plan; than going through this process.
    
    You should consider the alternative course of action and estimate your costs for both these processes.

Below steps will help you to understand how to convert your mutual funds in demat form.
