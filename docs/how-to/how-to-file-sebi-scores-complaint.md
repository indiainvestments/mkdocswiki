# How to file SEBI SCORES complaint?

## Intro üëã

As an investor, you've certain rights, and market participants \(AMC / RTA / broker / depository / advisor / distributor etc.\) have to make sure your rights are not violated.

Indian securities markets are highly regulated. And if you're not satisfied with resolution of an ongoing issue with your broker or AMC you're investing with; you can approach SEBI \(**S**ecurities and **E**xchange **B**oard of **I**ndia\) to hear you out.

For any grievance related to the securities market, with a listed company/ intermediary registered with SEBI you can file a complaint with SEBI if you are not satisfied with the response from the party.

What is an _intermediary_ in this context?
