It helps with their immediate need for cash. Which they would invest in growing their business. The belief here is they can generate much higher return than it'd cost to pay interest on that loan raised through bonds. Central banks, governments etc. do it for similar reasons as well; but instead of business growth, they're more focused on controlling flow of money within economy and issuing bonds in capital markets is how they start. The buyer of bonds is getting interest on money lent out against bonds.</p> <p>Is currency a bond?</p> <p>You might think that 10 rupee note in your pocket is a bond issued by RBI, because it clearly has the signature of RBI Governor, and some legalese printed on that.

The first issued bond can be traced to Mesopotamia in around 2400 BC. The bond was backed by grain similar to how modern era secured bonds are backed by assets, as was customary of the time. Failure to repay the bond resulted in forfeiture of this surety. The staple currency in the era was corn. As loans were primarily taken to finance growing crop or herding cattle, interest payments were made in the form of the harvests of said crops. Over time silver became the dominant currency due to the perish-ability of other commodities. The modern form of bonds came to life when European merchants started lending to the aristocracy to fund sovereign spending.</p>"},{"location":"bonds/#what-to-look-for","title":"What to look for?","text":"<p>Bonds can be issued by Governments (sovereign entities) or by corporates.

Think about how you might want to pay off a loan after getting a promotion with a large hike. Quite often a bond that offers a yield much higher than average will be \"called\" so it is prudent to check both the yield to maturity (yield which you will get if held till maturity) and yield until the date when the issuer has a right to call the bond. As an addendum there is another feature in some bonds called a put option which is the reverse ie it lets the bond holder force the issuer to pay the money back early, a premature FD closure if you may.</p>"},{"location":"bonds/#credit-quality","title":"Credit Quality","text":"<p>As mentioned earlier not all bonds are made equal.

Bonds that are issued by private and public corporations are known as corporate bonds. Companies may issue debt to raise money for a variety of purposes for example to raise money for a new plant and these bonds act as a way for people to lend money directly to the company.</p>"},{"location":"bonds/corporate-bonds/#not-all-bonds-are-made-equal-aka-credit-risk","title":"Not all bonds are made equal (AKA Credit Risk)","text":"<p>If you have compared fixed deposit rates at various banks, you would have noticed the big three (SBI, HDFC, ICICI) tend to have lower interest rates on their fixed deposits when compared to smaller players. The other end of the spectrum tends to be small finance banks which tend to offer a good 3-4% over what a major bank would offer. This parity in rates is due to risk and the same applies to bonds issued by companies. Bonds issued by a robust bluechip company has a much lower chance of default than one issued by a shakey unprofitable smallcap.</p> <p>There needs to be a way gauge this risk and that is why we have something known as a credit rating. Credit ratings are like your CIBIL scores, just for companies. Broadly speaking there are:</p> <ul> <li>CRISIL Limited</li> <li>India Ratings and Research Pvt Ltd</li> <li>ICRA Limited</li> <li>CARE</li> <li>Brickwork Ratings India Pvt Ltd</li> <li>SMERA Ratings Limited</li> <li>Infometrics Valuation and Rating Pvt Ltd</li> </ul> <p>Generally, speaking a company issuing debt will get themselves rated by one or more of these agencies and they will issue a grade to their company based on the category. There is a separate rating and rating scale for each type of debt issued - long term debt, short term and FDs (there are more subcategories but we will limit ourselves to the three main types).</p> <p>As the names imply each rating is tailed for the specific type of debt security issued. Each rating agency has their own scale which is publicly available but most ratings go from AAA (safest) to D (default) with BBB being the lowest possible grade for investment grade debt (Colloquially, AAA is commonly used but short term debt is usually rated from A1 to D where A1 is the equivalent to AAA). Any debt with a rating less than that is considered to be junk debt and often will not get investments from pension funds, some mutual funds, etc due to guidelines by their regulators. Colloquially, some bonds are considered to \"pseudo SOV rated\". These are generally bonds issued by PSUs and PSBs and there is an assumption that the government will recapitalize these entities incase of a default. There is some merit to this argument but it is prudent to assume some risk as there is no guarantee that requirements the government to bail out bond holders.</p> <p>While a useful metric to analyse the overall risk, it is important to note that these ratings are merely a reference and taking these ratings at face value can backfire and history has several examples of this - the meltdown of AAA rated Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS) during the 2008 financial crisis.</p>"},{"location":"bonds/corporate-bonds/#types","title":"Types","text":"<p>There are a couple of types of debt based securities that companies can issued and these have different consequences both for the company and the investor.</p>"},{"location":"bonds/corporate-bonds/#corporate-fixed-deposits","title":"Corporate Fixed Deposits","text":"<p>Corporate Fixed Deposits are similar but not the same as bank deposits in that they are not market based securities. Similar to how you would do in a bank you can deposit a variable amount of money for a duration of your choice provided by the company. Unlike a bond these are not market based, which means liquidity is provided entirely by the company. If you want to exit a traditional bond then you can do that at any time by selling the security in the secondary markets ie the exchanges NSE/BSE through your broker (though you might end up selling for a discount if there isn't enough liquidity). This is not possible with a corporate fixed deposit as these are not listed, if you want to get your money back early then you need to go through their early withdrawal process which may have a penalty of 1-2% on the interest.</p> <p>Furthermore, it is very important to note that corporate fixed deposits are not backed by RBI and DICGC's 5L insurance and if the company goes insolvent then there is a risk of default and the only option for you would be either to sue or wait to get your proceeds from any resulting liquidation process. The \"reward\" for taking this is risk is usually a much higher rate of interest over bank fixed deposits.</p> <p>In terms of taxation, these are taxed similarly to bank FDs and tax is deducted at source unless you provide a 15G/H form if you're under the tax slabs.</p>"},{"location":"bonds/corporate-bonds/#non-convertible-debentures-ncds","title":"Non Convertible Debentures (NCDs)","text":"<p>Non\u2010Convertible Debenture is a financial instrument issued by Corporates for specified tenure to raise funds through public issue or private placement. The non convertible in the name implies that the debentures are not convertible to equity (some types of convertible debentures can be swapped for equity shares for example). These can be issued by Companies, including Non-Banking Finance Companies (NBFCs) or any corporate bodies worth more than \u20b9100 crore that are permitted to issue debt by the Reserve Bank of India. Furthermore, these issuers must be rated by at least one Credit Rating Agency(CRA). If they plan to issue \u20b91000 crore or more in debt they must be rated by two CRAs. The minimum credit rating must be atleast A3 for issue.</p> <p>Unlike a fixed deposit these are listed securities and investors can exit their investment by selling the debentures on the markets. As with any market linked securities these can suffer from changes to interest rates ie a rise in interest rates can make your NCBs to be worth less and vice versa. There can also be a spread (ie if the debenture is worth \u20b9100, sellers might want 104 while buyers offer only 96 which means you lose money both to enter and exit) due to a lack of liquidity in the market for the particular instrument. As with any corporate instruments, NCDs, are not backed by RBI and DICGC's 5L insurance and if the company goes insolvent then there is a risk of default. There are two types of NCDs:</p> <ul> <li>Secured: Investors can claim the company's assets incase of a default</li> <li>Unsecured: Investors can't directly stake a claim on the company's assets</li> </ul> <p>In terms of taxation if NCDs are sold within a year or lesser STCG will be applicable as per the income tax slab rate.

Treasury bills (T-bills) offer short-term investment opportunities, generally up to one year and are issued by the RBI for managing short-term liquidity. Treasury bills can be issued in a physical form as a promissory note or dematerialized form. It is a promissory note with a guarantee of payment at a later date and is backed by the Govt of India and Reserve Bank of India hence assured yields and zero risk of default. Which means that these are zero coupon instruments that do not pay out any interest and instead the interest component is the difference between the price the face value and the price they are are sold at. They are available in four durations - 14 day, 91 day, 182 day and 364 day T Bills.</p> <p>Thumb rule calculations would work like this:</p> <ul> <li>14 days bill = 1/2 month = 1/24 year</li> <li>91 days bill = 3 months = 1/4 year</li> <li>182 days bill = 6 months = 1/2 year</li> <li>364 days bill = 12 months = 1 year</li> </ul> <p>For example, the 91 day bill can have a face value of \u20b9100 and issued at \u20b998. That means you can purchase it at \u20b998 and when it completes 91 days, you will sell it back and get \u20b9100. Cost of \u20b998 and payout of \u20b9100 with a profit of \u20b92. This \u20b92 is the interest over 3 months and the effective rate is about 8%.</p> <p>To formalize this into a formula that a bond trader may use: <code>Annualized Yield = Interest for the duration of the bond * Modifier</code> The first part of the formula can be understood as <code>(Face Value - Issue Price) * 100 / Issue Price</code>. Which in our example ended up being 2.88%. The second part of the formula is a modifier that would convert the yield from an absolute return to an annualized one. Mathematically this would be <code>(365 / Duration of bond in days.)</code>. Comprehensively, the annualized yield works out to be <code>Annualized Yield = [(100-P)/P]*[365/D]*100</code> where <code>P</code> is the price of issue and <code>D</code> is the duration in days.</p> <p>14-day and 91-day T-bills are auctioned every week on Fridays, 182-day and 364-day T-bills are auctioned every alternate week on Wednesdays.</p> <p>Detailed maths located below</p>"},{"location":"bonds/section-2-government-securities/#cash-management-bills-cmbs","title":"Cash Management Bills (CMBs)","text":"<p>These are very similar in nature to treasury bills, however these are issued with maturities shorter than 91 days.

Over-simplified &amp; shortened description of how it works: It collects premium from policyholders, then it invests that in market-linked securities (bonds, stocks, CP, CD, commodities etc.). Eventually, it pays out policyholders after keeping some cut for itself.</p> <p>Unlike bank or post-office deposits, LIC returns are not legally guaranteed. Govt. of India is a major stakeholder in LIC, but that does not mean it's a major stakeholder in your future. Govt. would do its best to prevent LIC from going under. But your returns come at the cost of LIC's income - when those two are at odds with each other, Govt. would pick LIC over your financial future.</p> <p>In practice, LIC returns money you'd paid as premium + some bonus. There are different categories of these bonuses: loyalty bonus, guaranteed addition etc. LIC wants to make you feel they're doing you a favor by giving you some bonus. Historically, a bank FD / RD at SBI would have had higher returns than LIC policy over a given period.</p> <p>You can know your bonus after the policy matures.</p> <p>LIC is also not allowed to invest freely. They are the largest financial services company in the country, and have much more cash than any other financial institution, that they can invest. However, large corpus of few lakh crores are not easy to invest. So they have to look for distressed assets, or wait for really bad market condition before deploying sizeable chunk of that cash.</p> <p>There's also political interference to consider - as evident from LIC's bailout of IDBI bank. LIC's hands are tied, in when it comes to where they can / cannot invest.</p> <p>Over long enough period of time, LIC returns have also significantly underperformed equity market returns, namely Nifty &amp; Sensex Total Return Index.</p> <p>Now, consider various charges on insurance (mortality charges, admin fees, risk premium etc.). These are not shown to you (the end policyholders); but these eat away your corpus and line up LIC's pockets.</p> <p>Your agent would tell you to invest in LIC policy, because that helps him earn commission. Your parents would pressure you into doing it, because most likely they'd not be aware of other investment options.</p> <p>The fact that it has tax benefits is of little concern, because gains from LIC policies are so low, taxing it won't make much difference in final corpus size, post-tax.</p> <p>At its core, an LIC policy is an insurance policy. The cover provided by this insurance is inadequate, to take care of your family's financial needs in your absence. A pure term cover is better, which works very different from how a typical LIC policy works.</p> <p>But none of the above covers real problem with an LIC policy - it locks you into a lifelong decision much early on. For a lot of people, who had subscribed to LIC policies 20-25 years ago, and seeing their policies maturing now - the maturity amount is probably not even worth a month's income.</p> <p>Due to inflation, the maturity estimate which might look huge today, would be much lower in value, upon actual maturity.</p> <p>These premiums cannot be changed once you start paying for a policy. You have no option of stepping up your premiums as your salary increases year on year.</p> <p>Overall, an LIC policy is rigid, wasteful, and doesn't provide adequate coverage. Tax benefits are not good enough to offset the opportunity cost (i.e. you're missing out on other efficient assets and time).</p> <p>Avoid LIC policies, buy vanilla pure term cover, and invest in efficient market-linked transparent assets yourself.

This reduces cost for the investor buying the fund. It improves returns by reducing cost over long run. Over any given period, direct plan of a fund would do better than regular plan of same fund.</li> <li>Fees There is no charge of any kinds of fees associated with buying units in a direct plan in the app, or setting up / cancelling SIPs. Note that some of these platforms have membership programs, or make some features available for a fee. We're not considering that here - only concerned with the ability to invest in direct plans, for any amount with any number of trades.</li> <li>Goal Setting A feature to set a goal for a specific amount of time so that you will be able to invest for it &amp; track it.</li> <li>Family Account Ability to manage portfolios for multiple accounts (For e.g., spouse, Joint account) from a single user account login.</li> <li>Assets other than MF Ability of the platform to offer other assets like Gold, FD, Stocks, Bonds etc other than just Mutual Fund. Note that Coin by Zerodha offers only mutual fund; to be able to buy shares or bonds or ETFs, you'd need to download other products from Zerodha.</li> <li>TAX Statement Does the platform provide the statements for tax filing purpose (For e.g., Capital Gain Statement), or just to estimate tax liabilities for advance tax payments?</li> <li>History Tracking Ability of the platform to track the history of our portfolio ,irrespective of whether we purchased the fund from the same platform or not. In other words, can an investor just sign up and import their portfolio, built over the years, and track the performance all in one place?</li> <li>Automated Reinvestment Does the platform to automatically change the allocation percentage of your investment to debt &amp; equity based on how near one\u2019s goal is?</li> <li>Skip an SIP Option to skip the SIP for a month or a predetermined time. Note: Several platforms stops the investment and then start a new round again instead of pausing. This might create issues, especially if AMC has put restrictions on new SIPs. Do check with latest updates on your fund, from your fund house.</li> <li>NAV Cutoff Time This time determines the Net Asset Value (NAV), at which you can buy the fund units for that day. If an order is placed after this cut-off time, it'd be processed as an order of next business day. Ideally, you'd want a platform that enforces same cut-off time as the fund house / AMC; and not a restricted form of it. For instance, Coin by Zerodha has a cut-off time of 1:30 p.m. for all funds on their platform; while one can place an order in equity funds after 1:30 p.m. on most other platforms, and still get the NAV of same day.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"faqs/mfs/best-mutual-fund-app-for-investments/#application-by-fund-houses-and-rtas","title":"Application by fund houses and RTAs \ud83e\udd5d","text":"<p>The fund houses also provide web portals / applications to manage the funds, offered by them.</p> <p>So you might end up managing a bunch of applications to track your portfolio, having to deal with multiple logins on different websites.</p> <p>Another option can be to use MyCAMS or KFinTrack.

Meanwhile, UTI Nifty Index had a total AUM of $$\u20b93,353.11$$ crores but had $$77\\%$$ of its AUM from its direct plan.</p> <p>This stark difference in the source of AUM should be enough to highlight where the priorities of regular plan distributors lie.</p> <p>We\u2019ve got the data about AUM distribution from this link on this page.

Indian markets are relatively young, been around for only a little over 40 years, in any meaningful way. BSE was founded in 1870s, but it's hard to find reliable data since before Sensex was created in 1979. Some even suggest to ignore data from before NSE was created in 1994, which gives us ~25 years worth of market data to analyse.</p> <p>Despite all these data, there's no prediction algorithm or deep-learning solutions; that can predict future market behavior accurately or near-accurately. Markets would surprise you from time-to-time, and new events would keep on happening in all markets, all over the world.</p> <p>Mutual funds give you exposure to markets, and their ups &amp; downs are linked to market's movements. It's mostly not up to the fund.</p> <p>Lion's share of performance of a fund, is due to luck - just having right exposure to right assets at the right time. Very little is due to fund manager's skill in asset picking.</p> <p>There are different mutual funds, that invest in different types of assets. Some invest in stocks, some buy debt, while some others bet on commodities like gold etc.</p> <p>The mutual fund that's best for you, is the one that help you with reaching your financial goals. If you need a certain amount of money after a given number of years; then for that financial goal, the mutual fund that helps you get there comfortably in time, is the best option.</p> <p>For most retail investors, the problem is not the right fund picking. Any average fund would be good enough for most people.</p> <p>Real problem is not investing enough, and relying too much on returns to make up for the low investment amount. Or not staying with a decent fund long enough.</p> <p>Asking for best mutual fund is no different from asking which gym is best for you. Finding the perfect gym is not that important. Just like it's more important to be disciplined, in achieving your health &amp; fitness goals, it's also important in achieving your financial nirvana.</p> Info <p>Please go through this link if you are interested in the ELI5 guide to selecting an equity mutual fund</p>"},{"location":"faqs/mfs/which-date-s-is-are-best-for-sip-in-a-month/","title":"Which date(s) is/are best for SIP in a month?","text":"<p>There's no such thing.</p> <p>It's rare for markets to move up / down so much in a single month, that a single SIP instalment being on a different date would make a sizeable difference in your long term corpus.</p> <p>If you start investing today via SIP, and analyse 10 years later, you'd find that, say for example, 23rd of the month was the best day to invest for your funds. That's something you can know only if you know the NAV history of next 10 years, which no one does.</p> <p>What about the apps that show you best date of SIP?</p> <p>These platforms or services are showing you, the \"best\" date, to prevent an analysis-paralysis. It's \"one less thing to worry about\", therefore prompting it to the user would mean higher conversion rate (assuming this is a metric these platforms are measuring - how many people complete setting up their SIPs).</p> <p>This is good for the platform, as it's helping the user feel psychologically safe that they're able to see some analysis, no matter how useless it is.</p> <p>However, the only thing they've done is take past NAV data, and found out what has been best date of SIP for a particular fund over a period.</p> <p>Since past performance is not indicative of future performance, anything derived from past performance is also not indicative of same metric for future.</p> <p>If between 2001-2010, 5th of the month had been best for a particular fund, say SBI Bluechip (not a recommendation, just using as an example) - that does NOT mean for next 10 years (2011-2020) same exact date was best for the same fund.</p> <p>For instance, some people believe that the last Thursday of the month coinciding with options expiry date, can be best for investment. This is obviously not backed by any sound analysis.</p> <p>What does a sound analysis here look like?</p> <p>You might find articles on the internet that draws some conclusions.</p> <p>Take the 2010-2020 period. It's a 10 year period, with 120 months. That's 120 transactions. Assuming each month to be of 28 days (to account for February); this would require comparing across 28 time-series data sets, with each having 120 entries; for every fund.</p> <p>But that's not all! Imagine someone investing on 28th of a month, instead of 1st of a month after salary credit (assume this person gets paid by employer on last day of previous month). Then these 28 days, this amount has been parked in savings account or overnight fund or even short term FD.</p> <p>A proper analysis on best date for SIP would also have to involve the interest income from this and tax paid on these gains, which again, have varied greatly over any meaningful period.</p> <p>As you can see, there are too many variables; and that's just with one single fund. India has more than a two thousand mutual funds, as of now.</p> <p>Finally, consider that people don't invest the same amount via SIP over a ten year period. Some people increase the amount of SIP that they do every year as their salary increases. Some of them pause their SIPs from time to time, or skip a few installments here and there.</p> <p>To sum it all up; there might be a best date for SIP in a month, and it depends on lot of factors that one cannot easily simulate with past data. But even if they did and found one, that date might not be best for your investment pattern for next 1-2 decades.</p> <p>Invest on a date of month you're comfortable with.</p>"},{"location":"faqs/mfs/why-are-index-funds-in-india-not-as-cheap-as-vanguards-index-funds-and-etfs/","title":"Why are Index Funds in India not as cheap as Vanguard's Index Funds and ETFs?","text":"<p>Before we begin, Total Expense Ratio (TER) is the amount that investors pay to AMCs for the operative and administrative expenses of managing a mutual fund.

So, a fixed number of members, periodic deposit monthly, deposit amount of rs 1000 and fixed total period of 20 months. In the first month, the total amount of deposit would be 20,000.</p> <p>This total monthly amount is called the Pot/Prize/Kitty.

The lowest bidder (one who demands the least amount) will get the money after paying the organizer fees and rest of the money will be distributed among the members. The lowest bid can be up to a discount of 40%. The distribution is usually by way of decreasing the monthly amount.</p> <p>Eg. if selection is by auction, and there are only two members (A and B) who want money in this month, then they can bid for anything less than 20,000. If A says he is ready to take the pot for 19k (he will leave 1000 for the rest of pool provided he gets the money right now) and B says he is ready to take the pot for 18k, the winner of the first month will be B. The foreman will deduct the organizer money (maximum of 5%, in this case 5% of 18,000 = 900) and give 17,100 to B. The remaining amount of 2,000 will be distributed equally among the 20 members, by way of this month's monthly instalment of 900 (and not 1000). In this case, the lowest allowable bid would be 40% lesser which would be 12,000.</p> <p>Every month the same process goes on.

What and Why of Mutual Fund Ratings","text":"<p>AKA Mutual Fund Rankings do not make Sense! Or Do They?</p> <p>You will find lot of media (print, TV, blogosphere, sites) screaming their heads off about 5 star funds. Friends swearing about some sites about 5 star funds. We will try and dissect the methodology of this, and then the disadvantages.</p> <ol> <li>The major sites (Valueresearchonline, Morningstar, Moneycontrol) first categorise different funds in different categories, according to their own whims and fancies (if you will check, they will tell you they have definite criteria but all those criteria are based on relatively short-term periods of recent past, eg. 1 year or 3 year). Few years back, VRO had a group of Diversified Equity, which later got divided into Large, Large-midcap, Multicap, Mid-Small cap. In future, it can happen with the higher number of funds, that there will be a Large-Medium-Mid and a Medium-Mid group too (who knows!).  </li> <li>According to their current portfolio, different funds are kept in different groups at different times. Eg, a flexi-cap fund like HDFC Equity will be placed in Large-mid cap fund group at one time, while at other times it will be put in multi-cap group (which is actually its group). So, the place of individual funds can change over time. Which means, if you categorise HDFC Equity as a 5 star fund in the large-mid cap fund group and later on, its group changes to multi-cap, then the rating of 5 star of large-mid cap is just junk for this particular fund. (For clarity sake, HDFC Equity can invest in any company, will prefer to get mid and large companies, and since its benchmark is CNX 500 (major 500 companies, so it is best characterised as a multi-cap).</li> <li>The method of Rating. A Risk adjusted Return is followed which includes a lot of maths, usage of exotic terminology like 'downside risk', 'utility function theory','risk aversion', etc. Then they compare monthly/weekly returns with a risk-free return (savings bank account rate or short term FD), and assign downside risk and excess returns, do some more jugglery in terms of percentages allocated to various parameters. Then all the funds of a category are separated into different star groups, the top 10% are awarded 5star rating, next 22.5% 4 star (so the top third are 4/5 star).  </li> <li>All these ratings are purely quantitative without any subjective component. If the main catalyst of all fund selection \u2013 eg the fund manager, leaves, there will be no change in the rating. Even, the complete change of the entire management team like Fidelity leaving lock-stock-and-barrel does not change the rating of their funds which have been taken over by L&amp;T with a new team. Amazing, if you really look at it.</li> <li>Then these ratings are disseminated to people in various forms and adverts. And people flock to the 4 and 5 star funds.</li> </ol> <p>What are the problems in this way? Is it not better to use 4/5 star funds than to use the lower performing funds (the 1 and 2 star funds)?. Yes, selecting funds on basis of stars can be a good start, since most of the long term decent funds are 3 or 4 or 5 funds. But the problems are:</p> <ol> <li>The ratings are calculated every week / month (as per category). So, it is possible for ratings of individual funds to change every week/month. So, a person who invested in 5 star fund on Friday may end up getting units allocated in a 4 star on Monday. How bad will that be for the person, and what will he do now with that pathetic looking 4 star fund (sarcasm!).</li> <li>In star rating system, there are no subjective criteria, which makes comparison of the performance of the same fund under different managers / management teams uncomparable.</li> <li>Biggest problem is a 5 star fund may not remain 5 star 2-3-5-10 years down the line. Then what are you going to do and how will you cope up with that. Past performance is not an indicator of future returns, which just means ranking based on past returns cannot tell you if the 5 star fund will remain 5 star 10 years down the line OR the 2/3 star fund will become one. So, all calculations of alpha, beta, standard deviation, volatility, etc BASED on past 1 year (this is most common time frame for these values) cannot tell you the future performance.</li> <li>Comparison of a different style of fund like Value funds (Eg are Templeton India Growth / Templeton India Equity Income and ICICI Discovery) with Growth funds does not work since they are not comparable at all, even if their benchmarks and portfolio capitalizations are similar.</li> <li>Then, if the top 10% of a group are 5 star out of say 20 (which means top 2 will be 5 star). Now let us say, there are 200 funds, then the top 20 funds will be 5 star. So, even though the relative ranking of a fund has dropped from say 2 to 20, it will retain its 5 star ranking - it just needs a constant increase in the number of funds and relative good performance.</li> </ol> <p>So how to proceed?</p> <ol> <li>Look behind the Quantitative performances of funds. You can start with the Qualitative Analyses provided by Morningstar for a start. Understand the Fund Company behind the fund. Have they been stable in retaining their management teams? Are they able to generate profits for themselves? If they are not, then it will be difficult for them to retain their teams for longer periods of time or sustain themselves, both of which can prove to be harmful for you.</li> <li>Is the fund manager(s) been with this fund for the last 3-5 years (over which the ratings have been generated and which has attracted you to it)?</li> <li>Is the style of fund consistent over these time periods? And can you stomach that style? Value funds can have long periods of relative underperformance followed by great outperformance as compared to growth funds. Similarly, large cap funds will have lesser volatility than say multicap or mid-small cap funds.</li> </ol> <p>If after selecting funds across these parameters, the fund ratings drop, then you just need to check whether the fund team is still consistent in their approach and their underperformance is because of market cycle. In that case, it will be more beneficial to accumulate more units of the same fund which will help you when the fund regains or upgrades its ratings.</p> <p>Remember, you make most of your money in Bear Markets, the only problem is you do not know at that time.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/all-about-mutual-funds/4.-how-to-select-a-mutual-fund-expanded-guidelines/","title":"4.

What do I do now?</p> <p>Relax. If SIP date is a holiday or non-trading day in a certain month, it'd be processed on next available trading / business day.</p> <p>You'd get NAV of that effective SIP date. It won't cancel or fail your SIP.</p> </li> <li> <p>It says first payment can be made now. Would this be lumpsum or SIP? Which NAV would I get?</p> <p>Assume you want to start an SIP on 20th of a month, and today is 1st.</p> <p>Some platforms and most AMCs would give you an option to make first-purchase on 1st of the month itself, for that installment.</p> <p>It'd be a lumpsum payment, with SIP limits applicable - but it doesn't matter, because we've already discussed above that mode of investment has no bearing on your returns or investment corpus.</p> <p>You'd get NAV of 1st, and not that of 20th. And your SIP would start next month of 20th (because this month's installment is going in today as first purchase).</p> </li> <li> <p>What should be the payment limit of mandate I'm setting up?</p> <p>Most likely, your intermediary you're transacting with, would give you a recommended amount. You're better off following that.</p> <p>Note that, you cannot edit a NACH or e-NACH mandate, same way you can edit a bill-pay mandate. So, it makes sense to set a high amount as limit for NACH mandates.</p> <p>It should be higher than SIP amount you're planning to invest.</p> <p>Actual debit from bank would be your SIP amount, not your payment limit.</p> <p>Payment limit is a daily limit on how big a bill your biller can send. It's there for security reasons, same way your Debit card has a purchase and withdrawal limit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can I migrate my mandate to another platform?</p> <p>In almost all cases, you won't be able to. Mandate is identified by URN, and as you switch platform, your biller's URN would be different.</p> <p>You'll have to cancel the existing mandate, set up a new mandate following process &amp; guidelines of new biller / intermediary.</p> </li> <li> <p>How do I delete this mandate I have?</p> <p>If it's a billpay mandate set up through your netbanking or banking app, you can delete it yourself.</p> <p>For other types of mandate, you can approach your bank and the intermediary. Most banks ask you to visit a branch in person to remove mandates, but some banks would also accept it over email.</p> <p>If you're having issues with removing a mandate, your bank's relationship team is better suited to handle this query.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"start-here/all-about-mutual-funds/5.-some-analysis-using-long-term-equity-and-debt-funds-in-india/","title":"8.

How to Become Crorepati using Mutual Funds","text":"<p>Mutual funds are outstanding investment vehicles after you learn how to utilize them correctly. Most people, however, do not have a solid understanding or conviction about mutual funds.</p> <p>The first absolutely essential point to understand is that the big money in mutual funds is always made by sitting through several business cycles. In other words, to reap large returns from funds, you have to have the strong belief and patience to sit tight for 10 or 15 years or longer. It's like real estate. You may not make anything if you buy and later become impatient or shortsighted and sell out after only three or four years. It simply takes time. Nervous Nellies are not good fund shareholders. Investors in open-end investment companies, as mutual funds are sometimes called, tend to buy the best-performing fund after it has had a huge performance year. The next year or two will probably show slower or poorer results followed by an inevitable economic recession. This is usually enough to scare out those with less conviction or the \"I want to get rich quick\" fund holders.</p> <p>Sometimes shareholders will switch to another fund that someone convinces them is much safer (usually at exactly the wrong time) or has a \"hotter\" recent performance record. Switching breaks up your long-range holding plan. I suppose you should switch if you have a really bad fund or the wrong type, like an income or industry fund when you should own a diversified growth fund, but too much switching quickly destroys what must be a long-term commitment.</p> <p>Bear markets can last from nine months to two years or more and if you are going to be a successful long-pull investor in funds, you'll need to acquire the courage and perspective to live through numerous discouraging bear markets. Have the vision to build yourself a great long-term growth program, and stick to it.</p> <p>The super big gains from mutual funds come from compounding over a span of years. Funds should be an investment for as long as you live. Diamonds are supposed to be forever\u2014well, so are your mutual funds. So buy right and sit tight, period!</p> <p>How to Become a Crorepati the Easy Way</p> <p>Here is what I regard as the ideal manner for a shrewd mutual fund investor to plan and invest.</p> <p>Pick a diversified domestic growth fund that performed in the top quartile of all mutual funds over the last 5-7-10 years. It will probably have averaged an annual rate of return of about 15-20%. The fund should also have a better-than-average record in the latest 12 months when compared to other domestic growth stock funds. Steer away from funds that concentrate in only one industry or one area like energy, electronics, or gold. The investment company you pick does not have to be in the top three or four in performance each year to give you an excellent profit over 10 to 15 years.</p> <p>When you purchase a mutual fund, you are hiring professional management to make decisions for you in the stock market. Most diversified funds should be treated differently from individual stocks. A stock may decline and never come back in price. That's why the loss-cutting policy (called Stop-Loss) is necessary.</p> <p>However, a well-selected fund run by an established management organization will, in time, almost always recover from the steep corrections that naturally occur during numerous bear markets. This is because mutual funds are broadly diversified and should participate in each recovery cycle in the economy. Therefore, I believe an extraordinarily different strategy should be employed with mutual funds. Each time you get into the thick of an economic recession and the newspapers and TV tell you how terrible things are, why not add to your fund when it is off 25% to 30% from its peak price. It might even be a possible time to borrow a little money and buy more shares. If you are patient, within two or three years the shares should be up sharply in price. Remember, you're going to hold through many economic cycles, so why not be smart and add to your investment during each bear market?</p> <p>You can also reinvest your dividends and capital gains distributions and benefit from compounding over the years. When you buy your growth mutual fund, you should make up your mind at the outset that you are positively going to sit through the next three or four bear markets or economic recessions. This will give you the maximum opportunity to make really big money.</p> <p>How about Income from Funds using the Dividend Option?</p> <p>If you need income, you may find it more advantageous not to buy the dividend plans of a fund. Instead, you could select the growth option of the best possible fund available and set up a withdrawal plan equal to 1.5% per quarter or 6% or 7% per year (=systemic withdrawal plan or SWP). Part of the withdrawal would come from dividend income received and part from your capital, but the fund should generate enough growth over the years to more than offset the withdrawal of capital, if it is limited to 6% or 7% per year.</p> <p>There are many Asset Management Companies, such as Franklin Templeton, HDFC, DSP Blackrock and Reliance Mutual that offer a large family of funds with varied objectives. These families could offer you the added flexibility of making prudent changes many years later. These funds have been having a very stable management team over the last few years, with a good and consistent management style across funds.</p> <p>How Many Funds Should You Own?</p> <p>As time passes, you may discover a second fund you would also like to begin accumulating in another long-term program. If so, do it. At the end of 10 or 15 years, you might own a worthwhile amount of two or even three funds, but there is no reason to diversify broadly, so don't overdo it.</p> <p>Those rare individuals with many crores could spread out in more funds which would allow them to place almost unlimited sums into a more diverse group of funds. If this is done, some attempt should be made to own different-style managers. For example, money may be spread among one value-type growth fund, one aggressive growth fund, one small cap fund, one global fund, and so on.</p> <p>If you own a growth fund which, by definition, invests in more aggressive growth stocks, it should go up more in bull-market years and fall off more in price than the general market in some bear market years. This is fairly common and in keeping with the nature of most growth portfolios, so don't get alarmed and panic out at the wrong time. During the poor periods, try to look ahead several years. Daylight follows darkness.</p> <p>When Is the Best Time to Buy a Fund?</p> <p>Any time is the best time. You'll never know when the perfect time is and waiting will usually result in your paying a higher price.</p> <p>Should You Buy a Global or International Fund?</p> <p>Yes, these could be a sound investment and provide further diversification, but I would definitely limit the percent of your total fund investments. International funds can, after a period of good performance, suffer several years of laggard poor performance.</p> <p>The Size Problem of Large Funds</p> <p>Asset size is a problem with most funds. If a specific fund has huge amount of assets, it will be less flexible in retreating from the market or in acquiring meaningful positions in smaller, better-performing stocks. Therefore, I would generally avoid most of the very largest mutual funds. However, if you have a fund that has performed well for you over the years and it has now grown large but still performs reasonably well, maybe you should sit tight. Remember, the big money is always made over the long haul.</p> <p>Checking Management Fees and Turnover Rates</p> <p>Some investors try to evaluate the management fees and portfolio turnover rate of a fund. In most cases this nit-picking is not necessary. A good fund manager will sell stocks when he or she is worried about the overall market or a specific group, believes a stock is overvalued, or finds another, more attractive stock to purchase. That's what you hire a professional to do.</p> <p>Why Many People Lose Money in Top-Performing Funds</p> <p>Believe it or not, half of the people invested in some of the best-performing funds in the country may lose money. How can that happen? Very few people buy during a bear market. They're afraid. Far more people buy much later, during a bull market, when they feel much more assured. Some of these people then sell out over the next year or two when performance is slower or down. Why not buy and sit tight for the rest of your life and make a big fortune?</p> <p>The Five Dumbest Mistakes Mutual Fund Investors Can Make</p> <ol> <li>Failing to sit tight for an absolute minimum of 10 to 15 years.</li> <li>Worrying about a fund's management fee, turnover rate, or dividends paid.</li> <li>Being affected by news in the market when you're supposed to be investing for the long pull.</li> <li>Selling out during bad markets.</li> <li>Being impatient and losing confidence too soon.</li> </ol> <p>To summarize, the way to make a fortune in mutual funds is almost always by your long-term sitting, not your thinking. If you purchase Rs 1,00,000 of a diversified domestic growth stock fund that is able to average about 15% a year over a period of many years, here is what could occur, compliments of the magic of compounding and time:</p> <p>In 30-35 years, this Rs 1,00,000 will go on to become Rs 1,28,00,000</p> <p>Now suppose you also only added 1,00,000 each year to your program and let it compound over the years and you also bought a little extra during each bear market while the fund was temporarily down from its peak 25%. What do you think you'd be worth?</p> <p>So, in my opinion, faith and confidence in our long-term future is a very shrewd and intelligent position to take and stick with for as long as you live.</p> <p>Modified from Advice by a book by [William O'Neil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_O'Neil)</p>"},{"location":"start-here/all-about-mutual-funds/analysis-long-term-equity-and-debt-funds-india/","title":"Analysis using long term equity and debt funds in India","text":""},{"location":"start-here/all-about-mutual-funds/analysis-long-term-equity-and-debt-funds-india/#part-1-only-equity-fund","title":"Part 1: Only Equity Fund","text":"<p>Data used: NAV of Franklin Blue Chip funds, since its inception.

Most people, however, do not have a solid understanding or conviction about mutual funds.</p> <p>The first absolutely essential point to understand is that the big money in mutual funds is always made by sitting through several business cycles. In other words, to reap large returns from funds, you have to have the strong belief and patience to sit tight for 10 or 15 years or longer. It's like real estate. You may not make anything if you buy and later become impatient or shortsighted and sell out after only three or four years. It simply takes time. Nervous Nellies are not good fund shareholders. Investors in open-end investment companies, as mutual funds are sometimes called, tend to buy the best-performing fund after it has had a huge performance year. The next year or two will probably show slower or poorer results followed by an inevitable economic recession. This is usually enough to scare out those with less conviction or the \"I want to get rich quick\" fund holders.</p> <p>Sometimes shareholders will switch to another fund that someone convinces them is much safer (usually at exactly the wrong time) or has a \"hotter\" recent performance record. Switching breaks up your long-range holding plan. I suppose you should switch if you have a really bad fund or the wrong type, like an income or industry fund when you should own a diversified growth fund, but too much switching quickly destroys what must be a long-term commitment.</p> <p>Bear markets can last from nine months to two years or more and if you are going to be a successful long-pull investor in funds, you'll need to acquire the courage and perspective to live through numerous discouraging bear markets. Have the vision to build yourself a great long-term growth program, and stick to it.</p> <p>The super big gains from mutual funds come from compounding over a span of years. Funds should be an investment for as long as you live. Diamonds are supposed to be forever\u2014well, so are your mutual funds. So buy right and sit tight, period!</p> <p>How to Become a Crorepati the Easy Way</p> <p>Here is what I regard as the ideal manner for a shrewd mutual fund investor to plan and invest.</p> <p>Pick a diversified domestic growth fund that performed in the top quartile of all mutual funds over the last 5-7-10 years. It will probably have averaged an annual rate of return of about 15-20%. The fund should also have a better-than-average record in the latest 12 months when compared to other domestic growth stock funds. Steer away from funds that concentrate in only one industry or one area like energy, electronics, or gold. The investment company you pick does not have to be in the top three or four in performance each year to give you an excellent profit over 10 to 15 years.</p> <p>When you purchase a mutual fund, you are hiring professional management to make decisions for you in the stock market. Most diversified funds should be treated differently from individual stocks. A stock may decline and never come back in price. That's why the loss-cutting policy (called Stop-Loss) is necessary.</p> <p>However, a well-selected fund run by an established management organization will, in time, almost always recover from the steep corrections that naturally occur during numerous bear markets. This is because mutual funds are broadly diversified and should participate in each recovery cycle in the economy. Therefore, I believe an extraordinarily different strategy should be employed with mutual funds. Each time you get into the thick of an economic recession and the newspapers and TV tell you how terrible things are, why not add to your fund when it is off 25% to 30% from its peak price. It might even be a possible time to borrow a little money and buy more shares. If you are patient, within two or three years the shares should be up sharply in price. Remember, you're going to hold through many economic cycles, so why not be smart and add to your investment during each bear market?</p> <p>You can also reinvest your dividends and capital gains distributions and benefit from compounding over the years. When you buy your growth mutual fund, you should make up your mind at the outset that you are positively going to sit through the next three or four bear markets or economic recessions. This will give you the maximum opportunity to make really big money.</p> <p>How about Income from Funds using the Dividend Option?</p> <p>If you need income, you may find it more advantageous not to buy the dividend plans of a fund. Instead, you could select the growth option of the best possible fund available and set up a withdrawal plan equal to 1.5% per quarter or 6% or 7% per year (=systemic withdrawal plan or SWP). Part of the withdrawal would come from dividend income received and part from your capital, but the fund should generate enough growth over the years to more than offset the withdrawal of capital, if it is limited to 6% or 7% per year.</p> <p>There are many Asset Management Companies, such as Franklin Templeton, HDFC, DSP Blackrock and Reliance Mutual that offer a large family of funds with varied objectives. These families could offer you the added flexibility of making prudent changes many years later. These funds have been having a very stable management team over the last few years, with a good and consistent management style across funds.</p> <p>How Many Funds Should You Own?</p> <p>As time passes, you may discover a second fund you would also like to begin accumulating in another long-term program. If so, do it. At the end of 10 or 15 years, you might own a worthwhile amount of two or even three funds, but there is no reason to diversify broadly, so don't overdo it.</p> <p>Those rare individuals with many crores could spread out in more funds which would allow them to place almost unlimited sums into a more diverse group of funds. If this is done, some attempt should be made to own different-style managers. For example, money may be spread among one value-type growth fund, one aggressive growth fund, one small cap fund, one global fund, and so on.</p> <p>If you own a growth fund which, by definition, invests in more aggressive growth stocks, it should go up more in bull-market years and fall off more in price than the general market in some bear market years. This is fairly common and in keeping with the nature of most growth portfolios, so don't get alarmed and panic out at the wrong time. During the poor periods, try to look ahead several years. Daylight follows darkness.</p> <p>When Is the Best Time to Buy a Fund?</p> <p>Any time is the best time. You'll never know when the perfect time is and waiting will usually result in your paying a higher price.</p> <p>Should You Buy a Global or International Fund?</p> <p>Yes, these could be a sound investment and provide further diversification, but I would definitely limit the percent of your total fund investments. International funds can, after a period of good performance, suffer several years of laggard poor performance.</p> <p>The Size Problem of Large Funds</p> <p>Asset size is a problem with most funds. If a specific fund has huge amount of assets, it will be less flexible in retreating from the market or in acquiring meaningful positions in smaller, better-performing stocks. Therefore, I would generally avoid most of the very largest mutual funds. However, if you have a fund that has performed well for you over the years and it has now grown large but still performs reasonably well, maybe you should sit tight. Remember, the big money is always made over the long haul.</p> <p>Checking Management Fees and Turnover Rates</p> <p>Some investors try to evaluate the management fees and portfolio turnover rate of a fund. In most cases this nit-picking is not necessary. A good fund manager will sell stocks when he or she is worried about the overall market or a specific group, believes a stock is overvalued, or finds another, more attractive stock to purchase. That's what you hire a professional to do.</p> <p>Why Many People Lose Money in Top-Performing Funds</p> <p>Believe it or not, half of the people invested in some of the best-performing funds in the country may lose money. How can that happen? Very few people buy during a bear market. They're afraid. Far more people buy much later, during a bull market, when they feel much more assured. Some of these people then sell out over the next year or two when performance is slower or down. Why not buy and sit tight for the rest of your life and make a big fortune?</p> <p>The Five Dumbest Mistakes Mutual Fund Investors Can Make</p> <ol> <li>Failing to sit tight for an absolute minimum of 10 to 15 years.</li> <li>Worrying about a fund's management fee, turnover rate, or dividends paid.</li> <li>Being affected by news in the market when you're supposed to be investing for the long pull.</li> <li>Selling out during bad markets.</li> <li>Being impatient and losing confidence too soon.</li> </ol> <p>To summarize, the way to make a fortune in mutual funds is almost always by your long-term sitting, not your thinking. If you purchase Rs 1,00,000 of a diversified domestic growth stock fund that is able to average about 15% a year over a period of many years, here is what could occur, compliments of the magic of compounding and time:</p> <p>In 30-35 years, this Rs 1,00,000 will go on to become Rs 1,28,00,000</p> <p>Now suppose you also only added 1,00,000 each year to your program and let it compound over the years and you also bought a little extra during each bear market while the fund was temporarily down from its peak 25%. What do you think you'd be worth?</p> <p>So, in my opinion, faith and confidence in our long-term future is a very shrewd and intelligent position to take and stick with for as long as you live.</p> <p>Modified from Advice by a book by [William O'Neil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_O'Neil)</p>"},{"location":"start-here/all-about-mutual-funds/how-to-select-mutual-fund/","title":"How to Select a Mutual Fund","text":""},{"location":"start-here/all-about-mutual-funds/how-to-select-mutual-fund/#principles","title":"PRINCIPLES","text":"<p>It is important to understand that selection of mutual funds is NOT the first or the most important step in the making of a portfolio.</p> <p>For all long-term investors, there is only one objective \u2013 maximum total real returns after taxes (John Templeton).

And once set up, you can modify the limit amount from your bank portal itself.</p> </li> </ul> <p>So, which one should you use? As always with most things, it depends.</p> <p>NACH is universal process for mandate creation. It'd work with any biller, any bank. It's time-consuming, but works. However, it's also error-prone, because it's verified based on signature.</p> <p>Billpay mandate is most convenient and transparent to end users - you can easily delete the biller from netbanking later if you wish to delete the mandate, you can even stop payments on some incoming bills through netbanking (some banks offer this).</p> <p>Sometimes, biller intermediaries like BSE would allow paying for a lumpsum order with NACH or e-NACH mandate. For you, the end user, the process is one-click. You don't have to wait for any OTP, no need to worry about payment failures. Just place the order in lumpsum mode, and let the biller reach out to your bank to deduct the payment - one-time.</p> <p>You could think of it as one-click payment.</p> <p>But BSE as an intermediary don't allow for lumpsum payments with Billpay mandate (the mandate you've set up via netbanking).</p> <p>There's one process of mandate being tried out by Zerodha and PayTM Money - creation of e-NACH Mandates via digital signing from netbanking. This mandate, once created, might not be visible in your netbanking portal or banking app. However, we haven't included it yet, because it's a new process, and not enough feedback is available on its failure rates, convenience etc.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/all-about-mutual-funds/sip-and-mandates/#faq","title":"FAQ","text":"<p>These are some common queries we see in advice threads and other corners of internet, regarding SIPs and mandates.</p> <ul> <li> <p>My SIP date was today, but no money has been deducted yet.

What do I do now?</p> <p>Relax. If SIP date is a holiday or non-trading day in a certain month, it'd be processed on next available trading / business day.</p> <p>You'd get NAV of that effective SIP date. It won't cancel or fail your SIP.</p> </li> <li> <p>It says first payment can be made now. Would this be lumpsum or SIP? Which NAV would I get?</p> <p>Assume you want to start an SIP on 20th of a month, and today is 1st.</p> <p>Some platforms and most AMCs would give you an option to make first-purchase on 1st of the month itself, for that installment.</p> <p>It'd be a lumpsum payment, with SIP limits applicable - but it doesn't matter, because we've already discussed above that mode of investment has no bearing on your returns or investment corpus.</p> <p>You'd get NAV of 1st, and not that of 20th. And your SIP would start next month of 20th (because this month's installment is going in today as first purchase).</p> </li> <li> <p>What should be the payment limit of mandate I'm setting up?</p> <p>Most likely, your intermediary you're transacting with, would give you a recommended amount. You're better off following that.</p> <p>Note that, you cannot edit a NACH or e-NACH mandate, same way you can edit a bill-pay mandate. So, it makes sense to set a high amount as limit for NACH mandates.</p> <p>It should be higher than SIP amount you're planning to invest.</p> <p>Actual debit from bank would be your SIP amount, not your payment limit.</p> <p>Payment limit is a daily limit on how big a bill your biller can send. It's there for security reasons, same way your Debit card has a purchase and withdrawal limit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Can I migrate my mandate to another platform?</p> <p>In almost all cases, you won't be able to. Mandate is identified by URN, and as you switch platform, your biller's URN would be different.</p> <p>You'll have to cancel the existing mandate, set up a new mandate following process &amp; guidelines of new biller / intermediary.</p> </li> <li> <p>How do I delete this mandate I have?</p> <p>If it's a billpay mandate set up through your netbanking or banking app, you can delete it yourself.</p> <p>For other types of mandate, you can approach your bank and the intermediary. Most banks ask you to visit a branch in person to remove mandates, but some banks would also accept it over email.</p> <p>If you're having issues with removing a mandate, your bank's relationship team is better suited to handle this query.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"start-here/all-about-mutual-funds/types-of-mutual-funds/","title":"Types of Mutual Funds","text":""},{"location":"start-here/all-about-mutual-funds/types-of-mutual-funds/#income-objective","title":"Income Objective","text":"<p>You have to opt for dividend option if you want to get the dividend declared to come to your account.

Or Do They?</p> <p>You will find lot of media (print, TV, blogosphere, sites) screaming their heads off about 5 star funds. Friends swearing about some sites about 5 star funds. We will try and dissect the methodology of this, and then the disadvantages.</p> <ol> <li>The major sites (Valueresearchonline, Morningstar, Moneycontrol) first categorise different funds in different categories, according to their own whims and fancies (if you will check, they will tell you they have definite criteria but all those criteria are based on relatively short-term periods of recent past, eg. 1 year or 3 year). Few years back, VRO had a group of Diversified Equity, which later got divided into Large, Large-midcap, Multicap, Mid-Small cap. In future, it can happen with the higher number of funds, that there will be a Large-Medium-Mid and a Medium-Mid group too (who knows!).  </li> <li>According to their current portfolio, different funds are kept in different groups at different times. Eg, a flexi-cap fund like HDFC Equity will be placed in Large-mid cap fund group at one time, while at other times it will be put in multi-cap group (which is actually its group). So, the place of individual funds can change over time. Which means, if you categorise HDFC Equity as a 5 star fund in the large-mid cap fund group and later on, its group changes to multi-cap, then the rating of 5 star of large-mid cap is just junk for this particular fund. (For clarity sake, HDFC Equity can invest in any company, will prefer to get mid and large companies, and since its benchmark is CNX 500 (major 500 companies, so it is best characterised as a multi-cap).</li> <li>The method of Rating. A Risk adjusted Return is followed which includes a lot of maths, usage of exotic terminology like 'downside risk', 'utility function theory','risk aversion', etc. Then they compare monthly/weekly returns with a risk-free return (savings bank account rate or short term FD), and assign downside risk and excess returns, do some more jugglery in terms of percentages allocated to various parameters. Then all the funds of a category are separated into different star groups, the top 10% are awarded 5star rating, next 22.5% 4 star (so the top third are 4/5 star).  </li> <li>All these ratings are purely quantitative without any subjective component. If the main catalyst of all fund selection \u2013 eg the fund manager, leaves, there will be no change in the rating. Even, the complete change of the entire management team like Fidelity leaving lock-stock-and-barrel does not change the rating of their funds which have been taken over by L&amp;T with a new team. Amazing, if you really look at it.</li> <li>Then these ratings are disseminated to people in various forms and adverts. And people flock to the 4 and 5 star funds.</li> </ol> <p>What are the problems in this way? Is it not better to use 4/5 star funds than to use the lower performing funds (the 1 and 2 star funds)?. Yes, selecting funds on basis of stars can be a good start, since most of the long term decent funds are 3 or 4 or 5 funds. But the problems are:</p> <ol> <li>The ratings are calculated every week / month (as per category). So, it is possible for ratings of individual funds to change every week/month. So, a person who invested in 5 star fund on Friday may end up getting units allocated in a 4 star on Monday. How bad will that be for the person, and what will he do now with that pathetic looking 4 star fund (sarcasm!).</li> <li>In star rating system, there are no subjective criteria, which makes comparison of the performance of the same fund under different managers / management teams uncomparable.</li> <li>Biggest problem is a 5 star fund may not remain 5 star 2-3-5-10 years down the line. Then what are you going to do and how will you cope up with that. Past performance is not an indicator of future returns, which just means ranking based on past returns cannot tell you if the 5 star fund will remain 5 star 10 years down the line OR the 2/3 star fund will become one. So, all calculations of alpha, beta, standard deviation, volatility, etc BASED on past 1 year (this is most common time frame for these values) cannot tell you the future performance.</li> <li>Comparison of a different style of fund like Value funds (Eg are Templeton India Growth / Templeton India Equity Income and ICICI Discovery) with Growth funds does not work since they are not comparable at all, even if their benchmarks and portfolio capitalizations are similar.</li> <li>Then, if the top 10% of a group are 5 star out of say 20 (which means top 2 will be 5 star). Now let us say, there are 200 funds, then the top 20 funds will be 5 star. So, even though the relative ranking of a fund has dropped from say 2 to 20, it will retain its 5 star ranking - it just needs a constant increase in the number of funds and relative good performance.</li> </ol> <p>So how to proceed?</p> <ol> <li>Look behind the Quantitative performances of funds. You can start with the Qualitative Analyses provided by Morningstar for a start. Understand the Fund Company behind the fund. Have they been stable in retaining their management teams? Are they able to generate profits for themselves? If they are not, then it will be difficult for them to retain their teams for longer periods of time or sustain themselves, both of which can prove to be harmful for you.</li> <li>Is the fund manager(s) been with this fund for the last 3-5 years (over which the ratings have been generated and which has attracted you to it)?</li> <li>Is the style of fund consistent over these time periods? And can you stomach that style? Value funds can have long periods of relative underperformance followed by great outperformance as compared to growth funds. Similarly, large cap funds will have lesser volatility than say multicap or mid-small cap funds.</li> </ol> <p>If after selecting funds across these parameters, the fund ratings drop, then you just need to check whether the fund team is still consistent in their approach and their underperformance is because of market cycle. In that case, it will be more beneficial to accumulate more units of the same fund which will help you when the fund regains or upgrades its ratings.</p> <p>Remember, you make most of your money in Bear Markets, the only problem is you do not know at that time.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/all-about-mutual-funds/what-is-mutual-fund/","title":"What is a Mutual Fund?","text":"<p>A mutual fund is an instrument / vehicle by which a company (called Asset Management Company or AMC) collects money from investors by selling units / shares and using that money to make investments.</p> <p>Depending upon the mandate; a mutual fund can invest in equities, bonds, a mix of both, gold, international equities, other mutual funds etc. So, mutual fund automatically does not mean equity mutual fund.

Congratulations, because getting started up is the hardest part.</p> <p>For investing in mutual funds, you will have the following options:</p> <p>A. Invest through an agent. They can be individuals, someone living close to you, OR they can be big institutions like banks or Fundsindia.</p> <ul> <li>The advantage is that they will do everything from their own side and you will just have to sign few papers and that is it.  </li> <li>Disadvantage is that you will be investing into regular plans of the mutual funds and lose out on the cost benefit of the direct funds. The regular funds pay back some fees directly to the agent.</li> </ul> <p>Steps: Call your agent and sign the forms.</p> <p>B. Invest directly with the AMC.</p> <ul> <li>Advantage is cost advantage.</li> <li>Disadvantage is that it can be a bit tedious. I mean just look at those steps.</li> </ul> <p>Step 1:</p> <p>If you are first time investor then you will have to fill up two forms and a cheque. I will advise you to select a single fund to start up the process and then add more funds as per your needs. So, start with a basic equity fund and with 5k amount (the minimum needed to start up) and then start your SIPs later on.</p> <p>If you are ok, then you can start up the SIP from the word go too. That will add up one more form (I mean 3 forms).</p> <p>Form 1: KYC form -</p> <ol> <li> <p>You will need an identity proof - use PAN card - self attested.</p> </li> <li> <p>You will need an address proof - use any of the available one.</p> </li> <li> <p>Get the intermediary seal-stamp from your banker/RM/Personal Manager. No need for any agent (although they are allowed to do so). On the form as well as the address proof.</p> </li> <li> <p>You will need to do an IPV (=in person verification) at the AMC/CAMS/Karvy centre, so you cannot send by post.</p> <p>Any future change in KYC details will have to be done with IPV mostly.</p> <p>The bank details will be set according to the first form you fill. If you need to change / add another bank account, you will have to send by post, a cancelled cheque and the relevant form.</p> <p>Call the AMC\u2019s toll-free number and clear your doubts, if any.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Form 2: Common Application Form for Equity funds \u2013 you can get a copy from the local centre or you can download and print the relevant pages (not the whole thing).</p> <p>STEP 2:</p> <p>Get the forms and a cheque to the local AMC office / Karvy / CAMS centre and submit. Don\u2019t forget to tick mark the online access section and give your email id and mobile number. Do call up their toll-free number to confirm the documents needed before going there. I have never been able to get things done in a single go \u2013 try to break that record.</p> <p>STEP 3:</p> <p>Once your account has started up and you have been allocated the units of your mutual fund, start the online access. In most cases, they will send a physical PIN/HPIN/Password in post, which may take 7-10 days, but once you have got that, investing will become very easy.</p> <p>Once you are an existing investor in any mutual fund company, you can start a new fund just by filling up the form with a cheque. No need to do KYC again (till SEBI re-requires it \u2013 they are pathetic sometimes.)</p> <p>For Franklin Templeton AMC, you can have a look at this page.</p> <p>EDIT: A recent article from ValueResearchOnline on the same subject - https://www.valueresearchonline.com/story/h2_storyview.asp?str=28708</p> <p>Things to Note:</p> <ul> <li> <p>When one opens an account with an AMC, a folio is assigned to the customer.</p> </li> <li> <p>Often, direct and retail plans can be purchased through the same folio. So, you could, in theory, open an account + folio through an agent. At a later point in time,</p> <ul> <li>when you are comfortable doing your own research in selecting the funds,</li> <li>when you are knowledgable in reallocating your assets among funds,</li> </ul> <p>you could invest via the direct plans through the same folio. There are a few exceptions - sometimes you may need to open a new folio with the same AMC. Franklin Templeton India may require you to do this, if your bank account is not captured correctly in the folio; your agent/distributor may have used a separate account during registration for handling payments and redemptions.</p> </li> <li> <p>KYC is a one-time activity. Once you complete the rather laborious KYC process, your PAN number is registered in a central database at one of the KRAs (KYC Registration Agency). Opening an account in a different AMC does not require a repeat of the KYC process. You may be required to provide proof of KYC completion, so if you receive a KYC letter from any of the KRAs - NDML, CAMS, Karvy etc., ensure you store it safely.</p> </li> <li> <p>If you don't receive a physical copy of the KYC letter (especially if you applied through an agent and didn't receive one), you could ask the KRA for a digital copy. As far as I know, NDML provides one, if requested.</p> </li> <li> <p>The physical or digital copy of the KYC letter may not be required during subsequent account openings - some AMCs verify the KYC status during registration, with the KRAs. Some AMCs are now allowing for online registration of accounts with no submission of documents, provided you completed your KYC. But others may not be well integrated with the KRAs.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"start-here/eli5-series/inflation/","title":"Inflation","text":""},{"location":"start-here/eli5-series/inflation/#basics","title":"Basics","text":"<p>Inflation is the rate of rise in the general level of prices.

But you asked for details. And you may not be the only one, and some may be newbies. This is meant for absolute laymen. Fire away questions if necessary.</p> <p>When you start off investing, unless you already have knowledge about various instruments, you are likely to get fooled. And you are more likely to be fooled by the people who already have knowledge about your purchasing power i.e. your bank.</p> <p>In India, banks are allowed to act as distributors for various investment products, including insurance schemes and mutual funds. There are cases where investors register a loss of principal when exiting insurance schemes. A similar loss of principal from mutual funds through the same modus operandi is less probable. You can argue that people can be suckered into buying equities when they are at a high, but still this cannot be compared in scale to insurance products masquerading as investments. After all, with insurance products, you get a free look-in period of 15 days to return the policy and get your money back. The performance of the product won't be visible to you, until much later. For an investment that is not liquid (holding period is often 3 - 5 years at a minimum), you end up in a situation where you are trapped with the product. You are then left with a few choices:</p> <ul> <li>discover how you got trapped, and whether you can complain to the company to recover your money. This was the subject of the article (more on this later).</li> <li>eat up the cost of surrendering the policy, and get back a smaller portion of your principal</li> <li>wait out the minimum period to surrender the policy at no cost.</li> </ul> <p>Complaining doesn't work, since there are crafty ways to fool the gullible into purchasing such accounts leaving little or no trace behind that the buyer was suckered into it. Remember that most Indians don't have the required financial knowledge. The regulatory authority for these instruments is IRDA and not SEBI (unfortunately), even though investments are made by the insurance companies eventually in the capital markets regulated by the latter.</p> <p>I'll cover the initiatives SEBI (and to a certain extent, the fund houses and AMFI) has brought forward in the recent past (5-10 years) to protect investor interests, because to understand how backward IRDA is, you need a reference point. SEBI has undertaken steps to ensure that the performance of the investments in the capital markets can be tracked in a transparent manner, and that distributors are not incentivized heavily to get investors to part with their money (except for closed ended MFs, but that too may change in the future). I'll call out certain features of MFs, some of which are notable in the Indian market because of SEBI -</p> <ul> <li>the schemes are color coded to distinguish the amount of risk involved,</li> <li>the brochures, KIM and SID contain sufficient information on where the investor's money goes.</li> <li>the performance of the fund can be tracked daily. Fund houses are required to update the NAVs by 10 AM the next working day.</li> <li>the holdings of funds are published in detail periodically (every month in some funds), so you know what the fund manager is doing with your money.</li> <li>front-loads are banned, so practically all your money gets invested upfront in the fund, except for the expense paid to the distributor, the fees to the fund management team, and brokerage charges</li> <li>the total expense ratios of funds are known are distributors are often required to disclose how much they collect in commissions when you invest in a fund.</li> <li>funds must have a benchmark against which their performance can be tracked. With the current tax regimes, funds have to perform every year; often investors prefer that the funds meet or exceed the returns from the benchmark. With the current exit loads of most MFs, exiting a poor scheme doesn't penalize the investor a lot in favor of the fund; you don't see exit loads like 10% or so.</li> </ul> <p>Now, when it come to IRDA and insurance products sold as investments, the story is quite different. IRDA resides in an era where the investors are expected to read and understand every item printed in fineprint in the brochure. It is down to the investor prepare a mental model of the investment and commit to the investment for a duration lasting several years, failing which the investor should be penalized. The insurance industry is beyond reproach. When you are presented with investor-facing documents on ULIPs, endowment plans, traditional policies, you'll notice the lack of transparency in these instruments:</p> <ul> <li>comparing the performance of the insurance fund with a benchmark is downright difficult if not impossible. Usually the comparison is made between the benchmark and the money left for investment after deducting charges (aka a portion of your premium depending on how many years have passed). Coming back to MFs, you don't see funds even trying to pull this trick when it comes to disclosing fund performance.</li> <li>then there is the problem with the charges themselves. You have a premium allocation charge which is deducted upfront (a portion is allocated for distributor commissions), mortality charge and policy administration charges for insurance, and finally fund management charges for managing the investment. Let's not forget service tax and cess. All of these work to reduce the principal invested in the markets. And then the surrender charges which hangs like the Damocles sword on the investor, forcing him to either forfeit a portion of his principal or have his money locked up for a period of time.</li> <li>the projections on returns are made in a very simplistic model. Even though the underlying investments are made in capital markets, the projections themselves are drawn up assuming the markets will grow in a straight line graph (at 4% or 6%; the projections are capped at 10%). Ask yourself whether any financial instrument has behaved this way. Your first premium may give 5% in the first year (after deducting charges), your second premium may give -10% (after deducting charges), because the markets would have given 5% and -10% respectively.</li> <li>who manages the fund, the analysts involved in the fund and their track record and the investment philosophy of the fund.</li> </ul> <p>Now, where does it start to go wrong for investors?</p> <ul> <li>Investors who start looking at new instruments after seeing miserable inflation-adjusted returns from the very simple savings bank accounts, FDs and RDs, are often pushed these instruments, on the premise that they are safe with no risk (hey, it's insurance).</li> <li>Most are scared of equities, because of advertising. Insurance ads paint themselves as guaranteeing safety (hey, it's insurance). SEBI forces TV ads to report that \"Mutual funds are subject to market risk. Please read the offer document carefully\" (often blurted in a manner to plant suspicion XD). IRDA doesn't require them to mention market risks (what luck). The stage is set to push insurance as investment.</li> <li>Distributors and agents can engage in variety of tricks in the selling phase. Products can be missold with agents/distributors stating that the investor can stay invested only for 5 years, when in fact the brochure itself mandates that payments be made for 10-20 years. The catch here is that the investor can surrender the product after 5 years, and thus can be misstated as \"needing investment for only 5 years\". There are several more tricks, but too long to list here. Basically, it is a free ride for anyone wanting upto 25% commission ^* ^(see ^reo_sam's ^comment ^below) on the first year's premium amount; the amounts reduce over subsequent years. There is a reason why they are loathe to sell pure insurance (term insurance) products to you - they don't get a lot of money out of it. When you pay a 1L premium, chances are 10-25k is paid to the distributor (the agent selling the plan to you employed by the distributor would get his cut). This is a very lucrative model. What could go wrong?</li> <li>Premium allocation charges are very high in the initial years, ensuring that a smaller portion of your principal is invested. They are not satisfied with the returns, and end up attempting to withdraw their money. But then, they would be hit by a surrender charge as well, ensuring that the IRR (internal rate of return) of the investment is negligible or negative. A negative IRR may force investors to stay invested longer instead of getting out faster. And the industry washes this off as standard practice to get investors to stay invested in the long run; you don't see this conducted on an industry wide basis for MFs. Throwing good money after bad is apparently great behavior to some, but they don't practise the same - how often do you see the insurance product manager investing in his fund. You'll however see MF managers and employees investing in the same schemes run by them or the same fund house.</li> <li>Recovering money locked in an investment is tough. The combination of surrender charges, and the onus of proving misselling that falls entirely on the investor means that he incurs a combination of principal loss and opportunity cost. This is why the article mentions that everything the agent or distributor says must be taken in writing (as proof). Otherwise the company can simply wash off its hands, until the matter goes to court.</li> </ul> <p>Misselling in insurance is basically a case of complex products (insurance and investments packaged into one complex product), incentivized to be sold to investors who may not be able to distinguish it from the simple products that they are accustomed to, with insufficient opportunity to back out from the investment (high surrender charges and price shock in a period occurring much later in the product lifecycle).</p> <p>Reddit Link: https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaInvestments/comments/2z7al6/letter_to_a_customer_buyer_beware/cpgffza/</p>"},{"location":"start-here/eli5-series/time-value-of-money/","title":"Time Value of Money","text":"<p>This is one of the most important concepts in finance. It implies that rupees paid or received in the future are different from the rupees paid or received today. It is easier to understand that \u20b91000 in your wallet today is worth more than \u20b91000 in your wallet 5 years in the future. This is because you can invest that \u20b91000 in your savings account and earn interest for 5 years and get more than \u20b91000 5 years later.</p> <p>There are 2 types of calculations which answer 2 different questions:</p> <ol> <li>What will be the value of an investment (or a series of investments) after a certain period of time? This question asks about the Future Value. Basically how much will be the Future value of the investment. Eg. You have \u20b91000 rupees today, so the Future Value will give you the value of 1000 rupees after a certain amount of time (=future).</li> <li>What will be the investment (or a series of investments) needed today (present) which would provide a target amount at a future date? This question asks for the Present Value. Eg, if I want \u20b91000 after 5 years, what would be the amount (called Present Value) which I would need to put in today.</li> </ol> <p>Two types of Interest Calculations:</p> <ol> <li>Simple Interest \u2013 SI = P x R x T, where P= principal, R= rate of interest and T= time in years. So, if the bank account gives you 4% (=R) and you put \u20b91000 (=P) for 5 years (=T), the interest would be (1000) x (4/100) x (5) = 200. And you will get 1000 (the principal) and 200 (the interest) after 5 years = 1200.</li> <li>Compound Interest \u2013 in this each year\u2019s interest also starts to get interest like the principal (if compounding is yearly).</li> </ol> Year Principal Rate of Interest Interest at Year End Total Value at Year end 1 1000 4 40 1040 2 1040 4 41.6 1081.6 3 1081.6 4 43.264 1124.86 4 1124.86 4 44.99 1169.86 5 1169.86 4 46.79 1216.65 <p>Due to the effect of compounding, one would get \u20b916.6576 more than what one would have got with simple interest. This looks small, but compounding has great effects over long periods of time.</p> <p>Eg. For a period of 35 years, an 8% simple interest on \u20b91000 would give you a total of \u20b93,800 (1000 principal and 2800 as interest). With compounding, you would get \u20b914,785 (1000 principal and 13785 as interest). A 5x difference.</p> <p>Future Value of a Single Investment</p> <p>FV = (Present Value of Money) x (1 + Rate of Interest) ^ (number of years). For our example of 1000 kept at 4% for 5 years, the calculation would be: FV = (1000) x (1 + 0.04)^(5) Or, FV = (1000) x (1.04)(1.04)(1.04)(1.04)(1.04) Or, FV = 1216.</p> <p>Future Value of a Constant Series of Investments The excel formula of FV is there for this calculation. A decent web Link.</p> <p>Eg 1: if you put \u20b910,000 per year @ 8% interest rate compounded yearly for 35 years, how much would you get? Ans. \u20b9 18,61,021.</p> <p>Present Value of a Single Amount If you want to have \u20b91000 after 5 years, how much money do you need to put aside today if you can earn 4%. This is the reverse of the calculation of FV. PV = FV divided by (1 + interest rate) ^ (number of years) PV = 1000 / (1+0.04)^5 = 821. This means that the value of \u20b9 821 today is the same as \u20b9 1000 after 5 years, if we can earn a 4% return on our money.</p> <p>Present Value of a Series of Investments</p> <p>The excel function PV would be helpful in this.

This means start transferring money from equity to long term debt asset.</li> <li>When the goal is within 1 year, then transfer the money from both equities and long term debt to Short Term Debt instruments.</li> </ol> <p>For you as an EXAMPLE, if the child is 3 years and you want to invest your 50 lakhs and use it for him/her partly for undergrad admission at 18 years (time horizon of 15 years) and rest at 25 years (say marriage or some other education degree). I also assume you have a fairly conservative kind of investment method.</p> <ol> <li>Put all the money into an equity oriented hybrid fund (eg. Franklin Templeton Balanced / HDFC Balanced fund. Basically, any fund with a long good track record backed by a stable and good management team), in 1 go (or say in a short period of time of 3-6months). Keep the money in there for next 12 years.</li> <li>At the age of 15 years of child, you migrate part of your money from that equity-oriented fund to a long term debt fund (in the same AMC) as per approx. need at 18 years. Eg. If we take a 10% annual growth rate (very conservative for this type of fund), you will have an approx. amount of 1.5 crore. If you want 80lakhs at 18 years, you will want to shift the entire 80lakhs into the long term debt fund for 2 years or so. While the rest 70lakhs will remain in the equity hybrid fund.</li> <li>At age 17 years, you will shift the value of those 80lakhs from the long term debt fund into a liquid/short term fund and use it whenever you need.</li> <li>At age 22, you shift the entire corpus from equity fund (approx. value of 1.1 crore @ 10% CAGR) to the long term debt fund. And at age 24, you shift it to a liquid fund/short term fund.</li> </ol> <p>VARIATIONS / MODIFICATIONS:</p> <ol> <li>If you have a slightly aggressive mindset (aggressive means you can undergo the deep cut associated with equity investments), you can use either a large cap fund (like Franklin Blue Chip Fund or HDFC Top 200) or a multicap fund (like Franklin Prima Plus or HDFC Equity or DSP Equity) instead of the equity-oriented hybrid fund mentioned above.</li> <li>It is not necessary to use Indian instruments alone. You may want to use your own resident country's funds too. Say you are living in USA, then you can use their index funds and manage accordingly. The basic idea remains the same.</li> <li>If you want to use a Ulip with a marketing name of \u201cChild\u201d placed in it (No, there is no major difference between a non-child Ulip or a Child named Ulip except as a marketing tool), so be it. Please do go through the Ulip primer to understand them first. The shifting across equity, long term debt and short-term/liquid debt instruments would remain the same in principle. There is one added advantage in the sense that the money will remain tied into that for the entire duration, which can be a good thing.</li> <li>It is preferable to use Direct route to AMCs if you are clear about the entire concept.</li> <li>One can take the help of a professional financial planner too for actual management of the instruments. The entire above thing will then at least guide you.</li> <li>If the goal is single or multiple, the above example can be modified accordingly.</li> </ol> <p>Some Major Questions which can be asked:</p> <ol> <li>Why one equity / equity-oriented hybrid fund? Many people advise for 3-4 funds. The reason being a well-managed single fund gives enough diversification. Adding more funds does not increase diversification. On the other hand, multiple funds start to make the entire portfolio like a broad-market index, at the cost of active management. If you want, you can use an index fund too (eg. IDFC Index fund is one of the lowest cost fund, while Franklin Index fund is well managed too but more expensive). Also, in case of real reasons for changing over a fund, it is much easier to monitor and change from a single fund to another fund company rather than juggling around with 2/3/4 different companies.</li> <li>Can Fixed Deposits be Used? They can be used in the end periods. In the earlier periods, because of adverse tax treatment of these (1. Taxable at marginal rate of tax, 2. Tax deduction at source and 3. Tax on accrual basis and not at the time of Realisation), I do not recommend it. The corresponding debt funds are much better in this respect.</li> <li>Can PPF be used? As the debt asset part, it can be, if the goal is beyond 15 years.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"start-here/insurance-policies/health/","title":"Health","text":"<p>How to Buy Health Insurance - this includes a pointer regarding Room Sublimits.</p> <p>Varun Dua (Co-founder of Coverfox.com) AMA</p> <p>Post/Comment Section</p> <p>Health Insurance for Parents</p>"},{"location":"start-here/insurance-policies/others-disability-home/","title":"Others: Disability / Home","text":""},{"location":"start-here/insurance-policies/others-disability-home/#householder-insurance","title":"HouseHolder Insurance","text":"<p>Comment</p>"},{"location":"start-here/insurance-policies/life/","title":"Life","text":""},{"location":"start-here/insurance-policies/life/faqs/","title":"Some FAQs on Life Insurance","text":"<p>Q1. What happens if the company I have bought insurance from goes bust? Is there any mechanism to protect customers like Deposit insurance corporation?</p> <p>A1. The IRDA regulations mandate that the solvency ratio (mainly indicates the assets versus liability adequacy) of the insurance company should have a decent margin of safety. Check this Link for more details. Currently, all the companies have decent solvency ratios. Hence, we do not need Deposit Insurance corp or any other such fallback for that.</p> <p>Q2. How do insurance companies use funds to pay? Is it 'pay as you go' OR 'is it that they invest the money and pay accordingly when the claim arises'?</p> <p>A2. In short, the latter. In the longer form the basic idea is that the mortality actuarial rates of the life insurance premium is calculated in such a way that probability wise, insurers make money on those. Eg, for a person of age of 30, the old mortality rate (used by LIC) was 1% (example) then they would price it as 2%. On a probability play, they are betting that if 100 persons aged 30 take Re 1 insurance per person, then only 1 of them dies (on an average because the mortality rate is 1%). They would then have to pay Re 1 to the dead person's family and keep the rest (Re 1) as profit. for regular term insurance, the company sets up a way to invest partially the extra premium (1% from the total 2% of the above example) and uses it to compensate in the later years. for single payment term insurance, the above is done in a much bigger way. for ulips / endowment policies, whether they are transparent or opaque, the mortality premia are deducted from the total amount regularly and work in a similar way as the first example.</p> <p>Q3. Can I have 2 insurance plans at the same time?</p> <p>A3. Yes. But you will have to declare that in any subsequent plan, if you already have any. The company considers if the total cover is within its risk profile or not. Eg, you can have 1 crore cover. You can take 1 policy. But if you already have a 50L policy, company will say, sorry boss, we don't feel comfortable providing you an additional 1 crore plan. If you are ok with 50L, we can do so.</p> <p>Q4. Should I have 2 insurance plans of half the cover each, instead of 1 single large plan? This will diversify the risk of claim rejection. This is a little difficult question. It is probably a simpler idea to have only one large term insurance plan because it is much easier for the family to get claim later on. If the company creates any issue, then the insurance ombudsman is the way to go. An alternative is if you already have some other small policy, continue that policy and use that as the diversification tool. The rule is that if one company pays up ANY policy in case of demise of the policy-holder, no other company can reject the claim (citation needed).</p> <p>Q5. What about the Claim Settlement Ratio?</p> <p>A5. I will first put up this link = http://www.subramoney.com/2012/03/insurance-claims-settlement/</p> <p>The basic idea is that the CSR ratios touted on the IRDA sites (and the individual companies' sites) are so opaque that you cannot differentiate between data of term insurance versus non-term plans (way too large in numbers), actual claims due to death versus maturity of plan, early (&lt;2 year) claims versus late claims, etc. Also, consider the fact that how can one apply the CSR data of 2011-12 to a plan which has been introduced subsequently (most of the online term insurance plans have come later). In short, it is a completely useless statistic. Just another point to be considered, why is the CSR of LIC not 100% ?</p> <p>EDIT:(2 more)</p> <p>Q6. Why is there a big difference between Smoker and Non-smoker premium in many Term Plans?</p> <p>A6. The difference is because some companies have differentiated the mortality rates of smokers and non-smokers and use different rates for them. In general, the chances of dying for someone smoking is more than someone who isn't. So, those companies have different options to pass that benefit to the consumers. Many others have decided not to differentiate between the two categories. If you will look more, you will see that even men and women have different rates.</p> <p>How to use this? If you are smoker, it would be preferable for you to use a company which does not differentiate between the two, so that there is no issue of this point. While who are complete non-smoker, prefer a company which gives you the benefit of being a non-smoker.</p> <p>Q7. Should I go with online or offline plan?</p> <p>A7. In the offline plan, the agent is in between you and the company and helps you to fill the form (rightly or in a few cases wrongly) and he does take a commission out of the total premium. The main point remains in case of claim, to use the services of the agent, (a) you would need to stay in the same place, (b) the agent has to stay in the same place and (c) remain with the same company and (d) he needs to really help your family in that case. All 4 conditions have to be met and the chances of that happening decrease with passage of time (who knows about 10 years down the line). While the alternate which is always available is to go directly to the insurance company's office, fill the claim form, put the appropriate supporting documents and get the claim. So, understand the two procedures and make the choice.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/insurance-policies/life/how-to-evaluate-life-insurance-needs/","title":"How to Evaluate Life Insurance Needs","text":"<p>Things to ponder over</p> <p>Apparently, most people tend to be under-insured. That's because what generally happens is that they get approached by some Life Insurance agent who works on a commission basis that throws around some jargon(despite what the advertisements say, this still happens), shows you an amount that looks 'big enough' on maturity or death. You ask how much premium is required, you take a cursory look at your monthly savings and wonder if you can go for it, you arrive at a plan that you think is affordable and boom, you pat yourself for being a responsible adult. More often than not, it is NOT GOOD ENOUGH.</p> <p>There are other things that happen too. Let's look at what happened with the Mumbai Terror attacks of 2008.</p> <ol> <li>The Government announced a 2 lakhs compensation for the victims who were killed. 1 lakh for the ones who were seriously injured. Ask yourself this, how long will your family last on 2 lakhs?</li> <li>A family member of a victim said in an interview \"My brother had a policy but I do not know the details of the same or where he has kept it.\" This is a more common occurrence that you would think. People tend to take life insurance but keep the details of these to themselves. May be it's because of cultural reasons. (For example: I don't have a spouse, so when I announced to my parents that I had taken a life insurance and enlisted them as beneficiaries, my mother went 'Tu chup kar, aisi baathein nahi karte!' (Don't talk about such things). I just told my father about which company that I was insured with. They have no idea about the amount of benefit they are entitled to in the event of my death. For those of you who are insured, ask yourself this : Do you know exactly what amount of money your family will receive in the event of your death? and then Does your family know how much benefit they are entitled to and how to go about it?</li> <li>\"Is terrorism covered?\" On the life insurance platform, insurers pay the sum assured for basic life insurance in case of death due to reasons other than suicide. This means that a life insurance policy will pay in case of death due to terrorism. However Additional riders(for which you pay a little bit extra premium for), like personal accident (PA) rider, which usually pay double the sum assured, will not cover acts of terrorism in most cases. Major surgical benefit, too, may not be paid if a policyholder undergoes surgeries arising out of a terror attack. Ask yourself this, what are the different ways in which you could possibly die/get disabled, does your policy and additional riders cover all these scenarios?</li> </ol> <p>Here's hoping that I now have your attention, we will now move towards the fundamental question, how much insurance do YOU need?</p> <p>In my opinion(humble ofcourse), Life Insurance should not be about saving tax nor should it be about making an investment or maturity amount. It should quite simply be, a means providing for your family, protecting their lifestyle if you are not around and ensuring that the goals for which you have worked so hard are achievable if you drop dead. Which ofcourse implies that everyone's needs are going to be different.</p> <p>Now there's multiple ways of doing this which have been broadly labelled as 'Income method', Human Life Value Method and 'Needs Analysis Method' . Let's start with my favorite:</p> <p>Needs Analysis Method</p> <p>Step 1: Determine the one-time expenses of your dependants (like clearing off your loans, siblings/children's education and/or marriage, etc.). Let's call this amount 'A'</p> <p>Step 2: Estimate your dependant's annual recurring expenses. This is 'B'.</p> <p>Step 3: Estimate survivor's annual income. Do your parents/spouse/siblings also work? Cool. 'C'</p> <p>Step 4: 'B' - 'C' = 'D' (Annual shortfall)</p> <p>Step 5: Multiply 'D' by the number of years you expect the youngest dependant or child to become independent and after that until your spouse is 80 or 90 years old. 'E'</p> <p>Step 6: 'A' + 'E' = 'F'inancial Risk that you NEED to cover.</p> <p>Step 7: Calculate the total investments and assets that you own. 'G'.</p> <p>Step 8: Amount of current life insurance. 'H'</p> <p>Step 9: 'F' - 'G' - 'H' = 'I'nsurance cover that you'll need to buy. If 'I' is negative, you don't have to do anything.</p> <p>Now, the challenge with the above method is guesstimating exactly how much money you're dependants are going to need on a yearly basis. You will have to factor in inflation and the averate rate of return on your investments. It's a huge exercise but if you truly louve and care for your dependants and all that, it is worth the effort.</p> <p>Income Method</p> <p>The Income method is more like a rule of thumb method and it goes like this.</p> <p>Take your NET Annual Income and then:</p> <p>If you are below 35 years, multiply it with 15.</p> <p>If you are between 35 and 50, multiply it with 12.</p> <p>If you are over 50, multiply it with 10.</p> <p>That's it. The resultant amount should be the amount of cover you ought to have.</p> <p>Human Life Value Method</p> <p>This one's a little technical but shouldn't be a problem if you understand the concepts of Time Value of Money,</p> <p>Life ProTip: Learn the concepts of Time Value of Money. If you have an average IQ, it won't take more than a day</p> <p>The most common definition of HLV is the expected life time earnings of an individual, i.e. what is the total income that the individual is expected to earn over the remainder of his working life, expressed in present Rupee terms.</p> <p>Step 1: Find your current income. Deduct all expenses. 'A'</p> <p>Step 2: Find your remaining working life or Years left to retirement. 'B'</p> <p>Step 3: Find the discounting factor rate. (For example, the rate of interest assumed for capitalisation of future income/salary growth rate). 'C%'</p> <p>Step 4: Find out the present value of required income stream by using inflation adjusted return.</p> <p>In Excel, this would be =PV(C%,B,A,0,1)</p> <p>Once you've ascertained the amount of insurance you'll be needing, the next step is to evaluate the different types of insurance products that are out there.</p> <p>Here's a useful link that breaks stuff down for the common man</p> <p>Remember, Insurance planning is an integral part of your overall retirement planning which in turn is a part of your overall Financial Planning. You do not necessarily need a personal Financial Planner to get this right. One of the objectives of this subreddit is to ensure that you make all your financial decisions independently.</p> <p>Here's hoping this post moves you into action.

Short Primer on Life Insurance as a comment: Link","text":""},{"location":"start-here/insurance-policies/life/term-insurance/","title":"Life Insurance: What it is exactly?","text":"<p>Life Insurance is basically a Death Insurance and better term is Income Replacement Insurance. It is a transfer of risk of your death, in terms of financial liability, from you to the insurance company. Like a car insurance, if something happens to the car, the insurance company will pay for the repairing work / or pay an amount according to the value assigned in case it gets stolen. Similarly, a life insurance is a contract between you and the insurance company, in which the company takes money (=premium) to ensure that it will provide money (=life cover value) in case of death of the insured person (like Stolen car analogy).</p> <p>To re-emphasize, by buying a life insurance policy, you have transferred the risk of your death (by disease, accident, etc) to the company.</p> <p>Principles:</p> <p>The Life insurance Cover should be the sum of</p> <ul> <li>All liabilities (loans \u2013 personal, home loan, relatives, etc)</li> <li>The amount which provides income required to maintain the current lifestyle.</li> <li>Should be able to provide for future liabilities like child education, home, marriage.</li> <li>It is better to be over-insured rather than under-insured. A reasonable amount is 10-15 times the annual income. This rule translates into a corpus amount, which invested properly will provide (1/15 to 1/10=) 6.7% to 10% of return and that amount is sufficient to provide the family a decent amount of income, which can then be used for daily expenses and rest for investing, etc.</li> <li>Only term insurance will be able to give you the above cover at a reasonable valuation. And like when we go with car insurance, we try to find a good deal, similarly presently, the online term insurance policies provide the maximum bang for buck.</li> <li>One or Two term policies. You need to remember that the insurance will be required to be encashed by your family after your death, so someone from the immediate family or close relative / friend should know the procedure of getting it. Online plans are available in most large cities and provided by most non-LIC insurance companies (LIC and most Private now).</li> <li>Non-term insurance plans. These are basically insurance plans in which besides the premium amount for life insurance (so this expense is there in these too and does not get removed at all), the extra money is put into various investment options.</li> <li>In endowment policies (most LIC policies are these), the extra amount is kept by LIC/non-LIC company in a non-transparent manner and \u201cinvested\u201d by them and later after very many years, they provide the cover value + bonuses (which are not guaranteed in amount).</li> <li>In ULIPs (unit linked insurance policies), there is a reasonable amount of transparency in terms of what are the various expenses and how they are distributed in various heads Plus in most of the policies, you can even decide the type of investment options. In general, these are much better than the opaque policies.</li> <li>Return of Premium Term Insurance- This is cheaper type of moneyback policy, in which beyond the basic life insurance cover, an extra amount is taken by the company to generate a corpus which will equal the total mortality charge over the time period of the insurance policy. These are invariably costlier than basic vanilla term insurance.</li> <li>Accident / Disability riders. With the detailed analysis of various riders, if you read the terms and conditions, then these riders are not really worth the amount of money spent on them. I will not recommend them in the way they are presently available.</li> </ul> <p>More Consideration about Options</p> <p>There are 2 major categories now available:</p> <ol> <li>Offline</li> <li>Online.</li> </ol> <p>The only major difference between the two is that the offline plans include the agent commission, while the online plan is devoid of that and indirectly you become your agent. Apart from that, the processing of papers initially, the medical tests, the claim process (in case it is needed) are the same for both the offline and online plans. And of course, since you are the self-agent, you have to fill the forms, attach the appropriate documents and send them to the company (basic rule is if you can reddit, you can do that too).</p> <p>Points related to LIC:</p> <p>LIC is the biggest company in every which way you see, in terms of number of policies, the total amount of insurance coverage, etc. However, there are 2 major points against it:</p> <ol> <li>Even though it was established in 1956, it did not start Plan vanilla term insurance till early 2000s, and only after HDFC Standard introduced it (I do not have the reference for that right now).</li> <li>Although, there were rumors about it getting an online variety, but few reports show that LIC has completely dropped the idea and Offline term plans (Anmol Jeevan for 25L) are available only. EDIT: They have an online term policy now (although, the premium is on a higher side as compared to other online policies).</li> </ol> <p>Important points for filling of any insurance policy-</p> <ol> <li>Give accurate information about whatever is being asked. This is the single most important thing to follow. The emphasis is on 'BEING ASKED', and that also means you do not need to go out of your way to provide information which has not been asked. If you have any doubt, call the customer care and get more information. You have so many options, that even if you reject 1 or 2 based on bad or confusing customer care, you still will be able to get another one with decent service. If the website is bad, customer care is bad, you need not proceed with the company at all. After all, if it is bad now, it cannot be good later on, if your family really need to file a claim process.</li> <li>Ask how the claim process is done. Most companies will show the claim process in some way on their website. Check it out. Usually, it is by providing death certificate and filling up of the claim form, which then has to be submitted to the insurance company's branch office (the agent may or may not help in this, so do not count solely on this. Who knows where will be the agent after 15 years.)</li> <li>Medical Test. This is done to refine the analysis of the risk taken by the company. If you adopt a cynical attitude, you will think that the medical test is unnecessary and just a way for the company to increase the premium (yes, there have been instances in which companies have done that in the name of increased nicotine levels or borderline hypertension or borderline high blood sugar or similar, but in most cases they will just ask for an increased premium and not rejecting it). If the company has increased the premium, then it is all the more good because if a claim is filed, then the company cannot say that this was not disclosed or that was not disclosed, etc. In short, if the company does not ask for a medical test, no problem. If it ask for a medical test, and does not increase the premium \u2013 good again. And if it increases the premium- still good. If it rejects because of the medical test, then its a problem and you will need to find out why that is so (also, this may be asked in later policies).</li> <li>The 15-day return option. One can return any policy (any means any policy approved by IRDA) within 15 days of RECEIVING it (not STARTING it). The day you receive it is zero day for returning, while the insurance cover starts a little earlier (when the company has generated the policy after medical tests, etc). If you are not happy with the way the company has handled the policy or their customer care or any thing, which you think can be an issue later on, you can return the policy and get back your money. The amount spent on medical tests is deducted with some nominal amount on paper work, while rest is given back. A small negative will be if you ask for another insurance policy to this or another company and they ask you about any previous policy, then you will be better off telling them about this episode (but only if they explicitly ask for it).</li> <li>The Company has after assessing the Risk and Medical checkup asked for Loading. Should I take it now or leave it? Of course, you should TAKE it. This means they have assessed you properly and with the proper re-assessment want to take that chance with your life. That only makes it a better policy for your family, since it is more likely that they do not consider that you are a horrible risk to them. In reality, you also want that assurance, indirectly. Secondly, if you will not go ahead with the Loaded amount, the company will reject it. And any such rejection will work against you when you will want to have another life insurance policy.</li> <li>Claim Settlement Ratio. This is much shown ratio comparing different companies, their settlement and payment ratios. It is a complex ratio which does not differentiate between pure term insurance (offline or online) or endowment and ulips and just clumps all of them into a single ratio. If you will see the number of policies and the total amount of settlement done, you can arrive at an average amount of cover per policy. The lower this amount, the higher will be the percentage of non-term insurance policies.</li> </ol> <p>The reasons for claim rejection are:</p> <ol> <li>Wrong medical or any other relevant (or non-relevant) data provided by the policy holder, whether online (on his own) or offline (either self or agent filled in wrong information).</li> <li>Wrong doing by the company. In this case, the insurance ombudsman is the way. However, the policy claim process is stuck. This also includes ways by which the process can be stalled or is deemed complicated because of logistical reasons. Eg, the recent floods in uttarakhan causing large number of deaths. It is difficult for the company to verify if the person is dead, or missing or some kind of fraudulent behavior on the part of the policyholder.</li> </ol> <p>Just remember, no company has a 100% claim settlement ratio. Ask the customer care or the agent about it and think about their answer.</p> <p>Companies and Options:</p> <ol> <li>If you want to have LIC and LIC only (because it is govt-backed, or its claim settlement ratio is highest, or xyz, then the offline plan is the only option. For private companies, ICICI, Kotak, HDFC, SBI Life are decent. There is an approximate halving of the premium between comparable offline policies between LIC and others. So, decide upon it.</li> <li>For Online options, Religare, Aviva, ICICI, HDFC, Kotak \u2013 all are game. Short informaiton about Aegon Religare- it was the first company to introduce online term insurance facility. With time, they put in some more refinements (and also because of competition), they decreased the premium. And added additional coverage to already existing customers (I have never come across any such thing from any other company) when they decreased the premium. LIC online is also available now.</li> </ol> <p>Do check the website of the individual companies, check the premium (recheck whether the premium shown is with or without the service tax) and then go ahead.</p> <p>TL;DR- go ahead with the easiest company which you find, with a decent amount of cover, and which does not give you (or your family) heartburn regarding settlement of a claim, if it arises.</p> <p>A Short Note about Financial Structure:</p> <p>Why does a term insurance levies same amount of premium for the entire term, when it should be lesser in earlier years and more in the later years? I will try to explain in an example.</p> <p>Eg, for a 5 year term for a 30 year person will charge, say 10000 per year. For the first year, the applicable mortality charge will be 6000, while the rest of the 4000 will be invested by the company into a debt type of instrument. Similarly for the next year, because of increased age, the mortality charge will be 7000, the rest 300 being invested. At year 4, the mortality charge would be 14000, which will be paid partly by the 10000 of the premium, and rest 4000 from the initally invested part-premium monies. This is just an approximation to give you an idea how the insurance company takes into account a same premium for a term insurance.</p> <p>Some more detail about financial structure.</p> <p>OTHER TYPES of TERM PLANs:</p> <p>Return of Premium (ROP) Plans:</p> <p>These type of plans are sold in a way to show that you get your premiums back. However, these do not come in online options (so much more premium). And, because of the ROP factor, the insurance premium is more than a normal offline plan so as to invest the surplus in a debt instrument and that is given back at the end of the plan.</p> <p>Additional Disadvantage: If one wants to leave the plan in between, the extra premium amount paid to the company is not given back. The plan makes you stick to it for the complete duration.</p> <p>Corollary Advantage: For people, who know that without such a loss-potential they will not sustain an insurance plan, can opt for this plan, as this is the least costly endowment plan. And, 'At least, some thing is coming back' mentality is taken care of.</p> <p>Increasing / Decreasing Term Cover plan:</p> <p>The main idea in these is that the Sum assured value should be dynamic and related to inflation or amount of responsibilities, etc.</p> <p>In my opinion, these just create additional complications.</p> <p>A good way to analyse things is in terms of Total Dependency cover which equals Life Insurance Cover + (Financial Assets \u2013 Liabilities).</p> <p>With age, the (Assets \u2013 Liabilities) should increase in a good way, so the Dependency cover automatically increases with time. If the Assets are not increasing, then it is a bigger problem in any case. So, keeping the Insurance Cover constant is not a bad option.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/insurance-policies/life/ulip/","title":"ULIP - Unit Linked Insurance Plan","text":""},{"location":"start-here/insurance-policies/life/ulip/#basic-definition","title":"BASIC DEFINITION","text":"<p>This is a single instrument / vehicle which gives Insurance and Investments. It uses the income tax laws to provide tax-free returns(most of them do, but changing laws sometimes changes the status of such plans \u2013 so always do check the actual laws and the relevance of the particular Ulip).</p> <p>In other words, Ulip is a type of mutual fund (in the sense that they get your money, convert them into units and professionally manage the money while charging you a management fee) which uses the tax laws to make the entire instrument tax free or as tax-friendly as possible.</p> <p>BASIC TENETS:</p> <ol> <li>The insurance component: Usually it is kept to a minimum. Prior to 2-3 years, most of the Ulips had a minimum of 5x premium of insurance cover. Why? Because the tax laws then said that for any insurance plan to get included in 80C section, it had to have a premium of &lt;20% of the insurance cover. eg. If the plan had to have a cover of 1 lakh, then the premium should be less than 20k. Then this limit was changed to 10x (=max. 10k premium for 1 lakh cover). However, you need to remember that the insurance cover provided is 10x on the lower side. On the higher side, it can be 20-30x also. There will be proportional increase in the Mortality Charges too. Compare this with the amount of cover which an online policy can give \u2013 around 1000x.</li> <li>The Investment Component: The money which remains after deduction of the various charges is put into one of the fund(s) allowed in the particular fund of that company. Then that money behaves like being in a mutual fund (gives the name Unit-Linked).</li> </ol> <p>VARIOUS CHARGES:</p> <ol> <li>Mortality Charges- Since this is an Insurance policy, there are mortality charges which are deducted usually every month (not quarterly or yearly). Usually, it is done in terms of Total Cover \u2013 Fund Value and the relevant mortality rate is applied. Eg. For a male of 30 years, if the cover is of 10lakhs, while the fund value of the policy is 2 lakh, the rest 8 lakh cover incurs the mortality rate of 1.91 per thousand which means an yearly premium of 1,528 (or 127 per month) plus service tax (12.36%). If the fund value is 6lakh, the mortality rate will be 764 per annum. Only when the fund value is more than the Cover, the mortality charge becomes Nil. The charge is applied by removing the corresponding amount of Units from your total fund units.</li> <li>Premium Allocation Charges- This is a variable rate and is mostly related to the Commission to the Insurance Agent. However, on the lower side, it is @ 2% while some years back it used to be 50-70% in the first year, then 20-30% in second year. Usually it is there in the first 5 years (basically the absolute or relative lock in periods). Prior to Sep 1, 2010, the Ulip structures were for 3 year lock in, so the major premium allocation charges were in those 3 years. Later on, the 5 year lock in was put, so the Ulips were redesigned to distribute the charges accordingly. Even the Top Up premiums undergo this charge but usually to a lesser amount. This amount never goes into Insurance or Investment at all.</li> <li>Policy Administration Charges- The company charges you this amount to send you monthly statements. It is set to increase yearly and is applied by removing units.</li> <li>Fund Management Charges- This is the actual professional management fees of the funds, and they are charged, like any other Mutual Fund, by daily deduction from the NAV of the fund itself. They are usually fixed but canbe increased by the company by intimating it to you.</li> <li>Surrender charge- Currently, if you want to surrender your policy in the first 5 years, then it is called Discontinuance and after deduction of charge (range of 2-6%), the remaining amount is transferred to a discontinued policy fund (where it earns 3.5% return, mostly with some kind of fund management charge) and the final amount is given to you at the end of 5 years. If you surrender the policy after 5 years, then after appropriate surrender charges, the policy is terminated and the fund value is provided to you. For Older Ulip policies, similar terms particular to that policy apply.</li> <li>Rider Charges- If the policy has riders like accidental death rider, critical illness rider, etc, then the appropriate amount of those charges are levied by cancellation of units.</li> <li>Guarantee Option- Some policies use Guarantee option in providing some sort of guaranteed return. Usually such options are completely debt based options and do incur an additional guarantee charge over and above all the other charges.</li> </ol> <p>In short, any type of benefit is charged accordingly, and nothing is free. The only major difference from the other traditional insurance policies is that everything is clear and written in Ulips while it is not so in those.</p> <p>FLEXIBLE OPTIONS:</p> <ol> <li>Top Up: Over and above the normal insurance premia, you can put extra amount of money as Top Up Premium. This now requires you to have additional corresponding amount of insurance (in the older Ulips, the additional insurance cover was not mandatory). Eg. If by 10k premium you get 1 lakh, an additional 10k top up premium can get you an additional cover which can be variable (eg from 1.1x to 5x to 10x). The other difference is that the Premium Allocation Charge is usually lesser than the normal premium. However, in the newer policies, the top up will have a lock-in of 5 years from the date of the top-up.</li> <li>Switching: Out of the various fund options available in a policy (some have 5, some have 7, etc), you can allocate the entire money in a liquid fund, or a longer term debt fund, a large cap type of fund, mid cap or multi-cap, etc. In general, out of the various options, you can allocate your fund money in parts or in total to 1 or more funds of that policy. Some policies have Automatic Switching options in which according to age, the percentage of equity-debt will change or according to an increase in decrease in the fund allocations, an appropriate automatic change will occur. Mostly, such additional options do incur charges but this also depends on the policy.</li> <li>Premium Paying Term (PPT): This is the period for which you will pay regular premiums. Usually the minimum is 5 years (in older policies, it was 3 years). However, there are single premium payment policies too. This option appears to be very confusing to many people. If someone opts for a 5 year premium paying term, he/she will be able to regularly pay premium for 5 years, and then depending upon the duration of the policy, after various charges, the net fund value will be given back to the holder at the end of the policy period. Eg, if the premium is 10k yearly for a policy with PPT of 5 years and total policy duration of 10 years, the valuation of those 50k after various charges will be given back at the end of 10 years. It DOES NOT mean that for the empty 5 years from 6-10 years, the company will pay it. Compare this with the same policy with PPT of 10 years and period of 10 years. The fund value will be more than the first example policy.</li> <li>The PPT, the frequency of paying premium and the Sum Assured are all usually kept flexible and can be changed.</li> <li>After a specific time frame (mostly 5 years), there is option for Partial Withdrawal of your money from the fund. It behaves like Partial Surrender.</li> </ol> <p>RISKS:</p> <p>The insurance risk part is borne by the company and the Mortality Charges are accordingly set. In this way, this part is not different from the plain vanilla term insurance.</p> <p>The investment risk part is completely the responsibility of the policy holder. This is the same as in any Mutual Fund.</p> <p>REVIVAL:</p> <p>For Ulips, there are usually no Revival options. If the policy is discontinued or foreclosed, then the appropriate option is followed automatically. Compare this with traditional policies, in which a policy can be revived later too.</p> <p>What is BAD about Ulips?</p> <p>INSURANCE Part:</p> <p>Firstly, Insurance is an expense and by combining it with a savings/investment option, the purpose of the entire instrument becomes kind of tug of war between two different aims. The primary way should be to check the eligibility and requirement of the life insurance for the person which includes:</p> <p>(I) Whether life insurance is required or not? If there are no financially dependent persons, life insurance is not required.</p> <p>(II) If it is required, how much is the requirement? For this calculation, check this post.</p> <p>The 10-30/40 times premium Sum Assured FOCUSES on the amount of premium which you can pay rather than the primary aim of The Total Sum Assured (Life cover amount). Eg. For a 30 year old male, the online plans give a sum assured of approx. 1000 times yearly premium. For offline the corresponding value is anywhere between 500-700. At higher age groups and with large term periods, there is corresponding lowering of the sum assured.</p> <p>In short, the insurance component of a Ulip is 99% of times inadequate as a sole policy.</p> <p>Secondly, the mortality charge table used in Ulips is higher as compared to mortality charge table for the same company in its own non-ulip term (offline / online) policies. In general, the inadequate insurance cover is expensive too.</p> <p>INVESTMENT Part:</p> <p>Part 1: CHARGES</p> <ol> <li>The Premium Allocation Charge is a front-loading charge, which means the charge is levied first and then the rest of the money is put for investment. Compare this with ongoing charges like Fund Management Charges or Back-loading (eg Exit loads in which the charge is levied at the time of withdrawal). In older times, when there was an Entry Load on the General Mutual Funds, which now is not present. This charge as mentioned is basically a commission charge for the agent and/or company, and does not help the investment in any manner.</li> <li>Policy Admin Charge- completely useless charge. Everything can be seen online and this charge is waste of money. Over that, this charge usually increases year on year.</li> <li>Surrender / Discontinuance Charges. This is the back-end load and decreases the liquidity of the money.</li> </ol> <p>Part 2: FUND MANAGEMENT</p> <p>In older times, the insurance companies used to delegate the responsibility of fund management to the regular mutual fund companies and did not require a separate fund management team. Now they are required to do so. In most companies, the size of the investment team is small (sometimes even 1 or 2 main persons managing the various funds). The quality of fund management in insurance companies is thus lower than that of the regular MF companies. The 1.35 -1.5% FMC (adding service tax of 12.36% means this gets translated to 1.5-1.7% net) of most equity funds in the various Ulips is comparable with the charges in the Direct Plans of the regular equity mutual funds. Similar is the case with the debt mutual funds. If you will look in more detail, then presently the FMC of equity and longer debt Ulip funds is in general slightly lower than corresponding regular funds, while those of liquid/shorter term debt ulip funds is slightly higher.</p> <p>As far as I know, simple index funds are not available in any of the Ulips (I have checked the insurance fund section of Morningstar.in and have not found any index fund). For some people, this is a very decent option with minimum charges (but then, Ulips are not cost-effective at all).</p> <p>Part 3: The Various OPTIONS-</p> <p>Switching Options:</p> <p>This is touted as a major benefit of Ulips. The ability to move money from equity to debt at market tops, and then move money from debt to equity at market bottoms is extremely beneficial. The only problem with that is no one has been able to do that consistently ever (at least that is what all the major gurus say in the world all these years). Moreover, market tops and bottoms are only apparent in the hindsight and not when they are occuring. So, if all the smart people have never been able to do that consistently, how can that be expected from a relatively unknowledgeable / less knowledgeable person buying a Ulip. It may be helpful for a very select few, but not for the 99.9% people. Also, behavioral finance tells us that if given an option like that, most people would do it in reverse, that is put money into equities near tops and put money into debt near bottoms. This is even worse than not doing anything at all.</p> <p>Part 4: ILLIQUIDITY and LOCK-IN</p> <p>If the management team of a regular mutual fund is not performing to your satisfaction, you can remove your money from them and put that amount into a different company. OR you can remove your money within the fund company. In Ulips, neither you can change the fund management company nor you can transfer away from funds available in your particular Ulip to another fund within the same company.</p> <p>The surrender / discontinuance charges are extremely high. Compare this with 1-3% exit loads in various regular mutual funds.</p> <p>The Illiquidity costs in a Ulip are very high WITHOUT providing a corresponding degree of benefit.</p> <p>MAJOR CONS:</p> <ol> <li>Too many charges. = Expensive and Complex.</li> <li>Not-so-great management teams as compared to regular Fund Companies. = Suboptimal Management with comparable management expenses.</li> <li>Very Illiquid, without providing any corresponding benefit for that illiquidity.</li> <li>Insurance Benefit is too low for use and expensive as compared to a comparable term insurance.</li> <li>Complex Options which in general are worse.</li> </ol> <p>What is GOOD about Ulips (=Pros)?</p> <p>Ulip is probably the perfect option for those people who get utterly confused and get policy-paralysis or decision paralysis (No, this is not an uncommon thing. More and more options, after all there are thousands of mutual funds in India, just create a severe type of confusion and to prevent selection of a bad or suboptimal option, one just does not choose any).</p> <p>The advantages of Ulips are:</p> <ol> <li>They give you an equity based tax-free option in the 80C category. The other pure equity based option is ELSS (Equity Linked Savings Scheme). While private pension plans (like Templeton India Pension Plan and UTI Retirement Benefit Pension Plan) are hybrid debt oriented mutual funds with decent options) are also there. In case, ELSS get dropped in DTC, then these will remain as the only pure equity based plans (of course, one can choose an 80% or 50% equity option too).</li> <li>Although, the insurance component is inadequate in these, but as an asset allocation instrument (and NOT as a market timing instrument), this provides free transfer from equity to debt or vice versa. Free both in the sense of a number of switches every year as well as no payment is required in terms of capital gains tax as would happen if this is done outside between mutual funds or direct stocks, debt instruments, gold and cash.</li> <li>The trigger portfolio option and automatic life-cycle based asset allocation are decent options for people who do not have the know-how or emotional execution capability.</li> <li>The loyalty addition is a small bonus if the requirements are fulfilled diligently.</li> </ol> <p>In short, presently Ulips are mostly good in terms of behavioral financial aspects.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/investment-philosophy-and-strategy/","title":"Investment Philosophy and Strategy","text":"<p>WARNING: This section of the wiki needs an overhaul and the information presented in this section may not be up to date or reflect the current state of affairs.

Plainly stated, the Land of Critical Mass is a place in which individuals enjoy their own personal financial nirvana. Differentiation between earned income and assets is a fundamental lesson to learn when thinking in terms of critical mass. Earned income does not produce critical mass......critical mass is strictly a function of assets.</p> <p>Taken from Bob Brinker.</p> <p>Critical Mass, as a concept appears to be slightly different from the Retirement corpus.</p> <p>Initially, we grow our assets by savings. Investing these savings over time then starts to accumulate assets in terms of yearly incomes. A simple 10% saving rate, if not invested, will accumulate one year's income in 10 years. While with investing, it will do so in much lesser period depending upon the rate of investment return. Then one day, we see that we have assets worth income of multiple years. And after some years, the yearly growth of our assets can become equal to the yearly income. At this point in time, we have reached the Critical Mass. And now the possibility to retire from a day job / salaried job is a real possibility.</p> <p>Actually speaking, the salaried job then makes a lot less sense after that, since the regular income gets a worse tax treatment while the tax on the capital growth can be deferred for a long time. Much better to do the latter rather than the former.</p> <p>The best way to reach a Critical Mass is to save drastically in the initial years and accumulate as fast as possible. Although doing it the slow and steady way up to the 50s with wise savings is not a bad thing. By keeping this in mind, one can change from the more stressful kind of jobs to more relaxed ones much before the actual retirement.</p> <p>This way of thinking is slightly different from the usual accumulation phase where you work, work and work and suddenly when you cannot or do not want to, you take an (arbitrary) age-based retirement and hope to live off whatever you have got.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/investment-philosophy-and-strategy/lumpsum-or-sip-stp/","title":"Lumpsum or SIP/STP","text":"<p>Original Post and discussion</p> <p>This is quite confusing to many people, since the finance world touts SIP (Dollar Cost Averaging in foreign terms) as the best way to invest.</p> <p>Definitions:</p> <p>SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) = one invests a fixed amount of money at a regular interval (daily / weekly / monthly / quarterly).

Inflation Risk or Purchasing-power Risk","text":"<p>This is probably one of the biggest \u201chidden\u201d risk faced by us. I have made a small table which shows the official data of inflation (This is made by using Cost Inflation Index values in the last 30 years, which itself is calculated by multiplying 0.75 and the average consumer price index or CPI). Also, the rolling 5 year and 10 year inflation rates are also given. In my opinion, it would not be wrong to assume that even these values are smaller than the real inflation rates suffered by us, but then that is a separate discussion. Some main points, during the entire 90's, the average inflation was 10+%, while in 00's, it was moderate in the mid-00s and is again trending up.</p> <p>What does this mean? In the simplest words, Inflation is a negative debt which is superimposed on all types of investment instruments. For under-the-mattress cash, a 10% inflation means, the value of Rs 100 becomes 90 in one year, in terms of real value, even though, the actual value is 100 only. Progressing this over 7 years, it will make the real value 48, while the nominal value will still remain 100.</p> <p>Next, if you keep this in a savings account, then after one year, this value will become 104 (assuming 4% interest rate), but the real value will be 94 (in simple maths). After 7 years, it will have a real value of 65, but a nominal value of 128. This actually needs to be hammered in. Agents, advisors, media, etc show us the value of 128 and tell us how good that is, and how 'surely' you will get that nominal value (of course, there is least risk in a savings account), but in actual values, you have lost 35% of your purchasing power.</p> <p>Higher up, you Save (invest is a wrong word there. Even GOI only tells us that we have a great savings rate of 30-32%, and not Investment Rate, so....) in a FD which presently is giving you 9% return. Amazing right. But if you see, the inflation rate is on an average 10%. So, even with 7 year FD, your real value will be 93, while the nominal value will be 145.</p> <p>In short, the real return = nominal return \u2013 inflation. And this real return is what we should assume in our calculations. For long period of time, equities and real-estate tend to provide above-inflation returns. Whether this will hold for future, we do not know. But this is certain, most debt products and cash-equivalents (=the traditional risk free products) always lose in terms of real return.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/investment-philosophy-and-strategy/various-types-of-risks-in-investments/#ii-systematic-risk-or-market-risk","title":"II.

Hence, this idea is important as far as the basic strategy is concerned.</p> <p>However, how it applies tactically in individual cases and in an Indian context will be different.</p> <p>eg. many people think that since we can get 8-9% tax-free and guaranteed on govt securities (govt backing is as close to guarantee as one can get), we need not think about all this 3.5-4.0% withdrawal rates. But they forget the basic difference between a nominal return of 8-9% versus a inflation-adjusted real return. After 10 years, the same 8-9% nominal return will not be sufficient AT ALL in most cases. A lot of pension plans also show you similar things and make the income look big but it is not so.</p> <p>It really is a tough thing when you realise in these examples that even the best of the institutions with tremendous money power (and knowledge) cannot have a very high sustainable rate.</p> <p>The various endowment reports studied:</p> <p>I. Nobel Prize Committee Financial management Link</p> <p>The real return (above inflation) expected from the fund is 3.5% (while they plan to use 3.0% at least yearly). They have considered an allocation of 55% (+/- 10) to equities, 20% (+/-10) to fixed income and 25%(+/-10) to alternative investments (including hedge funds and real estate).</p> <p>II. Yale Endowment Portfolio Management Link</p> <p>They expect a real return of 4.5%. The main difference from above is that they indulge in lot of alterative assets and active management strategies (with alpha). A good case in point was in 2008 period, when they went too far in their strategy and were having a negative 1.5-2% in cash, and suddenly during the crisis, they were in a severe bind. So now they have corrected that part and keep a decent amount of cash with them.</p> <p>III. Norwegian govt sovereign fund Analysis Link They expect a return of 4% and unlike the endowment funds, they do not put anything into alternative asset classes. They follow simple 60:40 rule with regular rebalancing and following cost-effective strategies (read passive investing).</p> <p>Many of the online calculators have used 4% as a reasonable withdrawal rate for 30 year periods using Monte-carlo calculators. However, based on various rolling data periods of actual market returns for US equity markets, a 4% withdrawal rate will not sustain for 30 year periods in 30-40% cases (whatever be the asset allocation). At 5% withdrawal rate, the failure rate over 30 year periods increases to 40-55%. While at 3.5%, it falls to &lt;10% unless one is in 100% bonds or 100% equities.</p> <p>Why Monte-carlo is not the right thing? because the random number generation in those simulations is normal distribution curve related (while the actual returns are never like those).</p> <p>Why US equity market data? Since that data is long and reasonably good and since it is the most important economy in the increasingly globalised world, it mirrors capital markets to a large extent.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/retirement/primer-on-retirement-planning/","title":"Primer on Retirement Planning","text":"<p>Original Post and Discussion</p> <p>So, you probably groaned in your head when you read the title.

Resist the temptation to wonder if they've invented Star Trek style transports. A good way of doing this is to look at your retired parents and grandparents. What are their lives like? My folks spend a whole lot on groceries, medical bills and people's weddings and funerals. They travel every couple of months to visit their children or host their visits. The question is, are they spending more money than they used to when they weren't retired or are they spending less money?</p> <p>More often than not, you'll find that their expenses have actually reduced since their pre-retirement era. Simply because, they don't go out partying every weekend, they no longer need to spend on their children, they no longer think that over-priced coffee is the besht, they no longer feel the need to watch movies within the first week of it's release and so on and so forth.</p> <p>But then again, this differs from person to person. Some people assume that their post retirement household living expenses will only be about 70%-80% of their pre-retirement household expenses. Not a bad assumption IMO.</p> <p>So, going with this assumption, suppose you currently spend about Rs. 20,000/- per month on stuff like groceries and utilities, etc, assuming you'll only need 80% of your expenses, when you retire about 30 years from now, you'll be spending about Rs. 16,000/- only, right?</p> <p>Wrong again! \"Accept certain inalienable truths...prices will rise, politicians will Philander, you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.\" (In case you are wondering why that sounds familiar, it's from the legendary song called Sunscreen by Baz Luhrmann)</p> <p>What I am trying to say is, you will have to factor in INFLATION<sup>INFLATION</sup>INFLATION^INFLATION. The amount of stuff you can buy for Rs.100/- today will be a lot less 30 years from now.

Ceteris Paribus, let us assume that over the next 30 years the average inflation rate is 8%, then, to maintain the same level of expenses of Rs. 20,000 per month, 30 years from now, you will need to spend about Rs. 2,00,000/- PER MONTH. (You can do the math yourself using the FV formula in MS Excel. Rate will be the expected annual inflation rate, nper will be the number of years left to your retirement, PV or present value will be your present expenses).</p> <p>I am not sure what salary hikes are like in your industry/company, but for people like me who are in banking, if you are an average to above average performer, assuming you work continuously, chances are that your salary will rise in tandem with the inflation. In which case, you don't have to panic as much. People tend to shift jobs every few years and get an average hike of about 25% at every jump. This will hopefully keep your income above the inflation line. But let us assume that you are an average joe and that you won't be jumping around much.

Employees Provident Fund","text":"<p>You are probably already in on this. Read on to understand how it works.</p> <p>There are several crucial aspects about EPF that many would not know. For instance, there are two elements to EPF - EPF and Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS). The 12 per cent employee contribution goes to EPF. However, the employer's contribution is divided in 8.33 per cent that goes in EPS, subject to a maximum of Rs 541 a month. The rest goes to EPF.</p> <p>Features</p> <p>Interest rate: Interest rate on EPF deposits for 2013-14 is 8.75% (as announced on Jan 13, 2014). The compound interest is provided only on EPF part. The EPS part (8.33% out of 12% contribution from your employer) does not get any interest.</p> <p>Tenure: You contribute till you retire and then get the pension. An employee is eligible to earn pension only on attaining 58 years of age, after completing 10 years of service. Or, on having contributed to it for 20 years. In either case, the pensionable service or number of years of contribution are increased by two years. For instance, one has attained 58 years and contributed for 25 years. Then, the pensionable service will be taken as 27 years. Or, if contributed for 20 years, then also it will be considered as 27 years.</p> <p>Maturity type?: Lumpsum/Pension</p> <p>Minimum and Maximum Investment: You can always invest more than 12% of your basic salary in EPF which is called VPF. In this case the excess amount will be invested in EPF and you will keep on getting the interest, but the employer is not supposed to match your contribution. He will just invest upto maximum of 12% of your basic, not more than that.</p> <p>Tax Benefit?: Yes. The employer contribution is exempt from tax, while an employee\u2019s contribution is taxable but eligible for deduction under Section 80C of Income tax Act. The money which you initially invest in EPF, the interest you earn and, finally the money you withdraw after a specified period (5 years), are all exempt from income tax. Withdrawal from an EPF amount is subject to tax if it is carried out within 5 years of employment with the same employer. However, if you have not worked for at least five years with the same employer but the EPF has been transferred to the new employer, it is not taxed.</p> <p>NRI Friendly?: Nope. It is applicable to employees working in India for Indian firms only.</p> <p>Loan facility?: Nope. But you can withdraw.</p> <p>Withdrawal facility?: Yes. But only in the following conditions:</p> <ol> <li>Marriage or education of self, children or siblings</li> <li>Medical treatment for Self or family (spouse, children, dependent parents)</li> <li>Repay a housing loan for a house in the name of self, spouse or owned jointly.</li> <li>Alterations/repairs to an existing home for house in the name of self, spouse or jointly.</li> <li>Construction or purchase of house or flat/site or plot for self or spouse or joint ownership</li> </ol> <p>These are all subject to various unique conditions each.</p> <p>How to?: Well, your HR will take care of that.</p> <p>Here is an online EPF maturity calculator</p> <p>and here are some FAQs</p>"},{"location":"start-here/retirement/readymade-pension-plan/","title":"Why You should not Opt for a Readymade Pension Plan","text":"<p>One of my friends recently met a smart young supposedly \u201cIRDA approved financial consultant\u201d who gave him an overview of investing into a retirement plan (and which was not a Ulip, in his words). I was merely an observer.</p> <p>He gave him nice descriptions about the plan, and how that will be the best thing for his retirement and how he can then enjoy the best things in life automatically (only and only) if he invests in that plan. Awesome idea. Their fund management team had worked fabulously, and provided 15% returns on balanced funds (balanced funds = funds which can invest in both equities and debt). And implied in the response was that they will continue to do that for all the coming years. Great thing indeed again.</p> <p>My friend asked \u201cHow much will this cost to me?\u201d. Sir, around 2.5% are the total management charges. Hmm. That sounds decent.</p> <p>Next question \u201cHow much will I have to invest?\u201d. Sir, if you can tell us how much will you need, then we can tell you. Or you can mail us directly about that and we can get back to you with specific numbers. Fair enough.</p> <p>After the talk, my friend asked for the brochure, and asked them to wait for his call after a week. In any investment plan, delay the hurry.</p> <p>So here comes my analysis from the Brochure.</p> <p>\u201cIn this policy, the investment risk in Investment Portfolio is Borne by the Policyholder\u201d. In big bright bold letters. Inf= Ok. Good, they had told him but with an oral implication of 15% returns.</p> <p>Then comes a slew of good things and offers. Blah Blah.</p> <p>\u201cIn this plan, your premium, net of premium allocation charges, will be invested in an exclusive Pension Fund. At the end of the policy term, you will receive higher of the following \u2013 Fund Value or Assured Benefit of 101% of all premiums (including top-up premiums). Inf= So, the guarantee is what one pays over all the years. And they will add 1% to the total principal and return it as the guarantee. Even this is not free and comes with its own charge.</p> <p>Your maturity benefit will be used to provide you with post-retirement income i.e. an annuity which you have to purchase from us. Oh. The advisors had already told him that he can get UPTO 33% of that amount as cash, while rest has to be used for annuity or have to pay tax on that.</p> <p>If there is unfortunate demise of the policyholder, then the nominee will get the death benefit. This is Higher of 1. Fund value or 2. Total premiums paid plus interest @ 6% per year. And of course, if the fund value is less than the alternative total value, then the company will deduct mortality charges, based upon the age of the policy holder (more the age, more will be the mortality charges).</p> <p>Then there is a slew of different options, most of which I do not think I have any idea. Eg:</p> <ol> <li>Plan your maturity age. How is one supposed to plan the retirement age, will it be 55,60,65 or 70.</li> <li>Retirement needs. Which are extremely difficult to assess. Too many variables.</li> </ol> <p>Investment Fund- The fund in this case is a single fund, which is a balanced fund with a max of equity of 60%. Actually, this is not a bad option for a short-to-medium term (say 8-10 years). But for a period of 20-30 years, this restriction is a bad option.</p> <p>There is no information regarding the investment team (who are they, how many, how long is their experience, etc. How has the performance been).</p> <p>Then there are standard clauses regarding the investment fund and benefits (which I have already enumerated above). One important thing is again, the investment risk is borne by the policyholder (which means, if the fund value goes down, ultimately it is the policy holder's responsibility only).</p> <p>Some special considerations:</p> <p>Policy Discontinuance- Upto 5 years, if the policy is not paid continuously, the money will get transferred to a Discontinued Policy fund, which will get a princely savings account interest rate of the biggest bank of India (SBI) \u2013 currently 4% - minus the discontinued policy fund charge of 0.5%. Amazing.</p> <p>After 5 years, if one does not pay, then it will get an automatic surrender and the fund value will be paid back.</p> <p>At Maturity: Apart from 1/3 of the fund value taxfree cash, I will HAVE to buy an annuity from this company (or probably from other companies too). The various annuity plans have different monthly/ yearly amounts depending upon the prevailing long term interest rates, type of annuity and the company's analysis of the policyholder's longetivity (again too many variables to even give a decent approximation). So, even if they look lip-smacking (7-9%) at current rates, they may not be so 10-20 years down the line. Let us analyze this a little further. A 7-9% annuity rate may appear to be good, but if you realise that the amount provided is FIXED for the term of annuity, then that means at an inflation rate of 7-10%, this FIXED amount will start to look small within 5-10 years. And I am not even speaking about 20-30 years down the line. The purchasing power will diminish rapidly later on and this supposedly decent amount will look like a small amount later on.</p> <p>A Look at Charges:</p> <ol> <li>Premium Allocation Charges. 2.5%. So out of every 100, 2.5 will be cut and never invested at all. Why? Do not know. Compare this to normal mutual funds \u2013 zero. Of course, this charge will continue for 1-10 years, and 11th year onwards, they will give me 102.5% of my premium. Which means they will add an extra 2.5% and invest that amount. Good. But a 2.5% cut in first year does not match with a 2.5% addition in later years. Then some plans are said to be for 10 years only. Even the top up premiums get a 1% deduction. Absolutely horrible.</li> <li>Policy Admin Charges. 0.4% per month of Premium. So that means, about 5% (12x0.4=4.8) of the premium will be deducted in administering my policy over and above the normal fund charges.</li> <li>Mortality Charges- If the fund value is less than the alternative mortality benefit (premiums @ 6% value), then a corresponding amount of life cover will be given and the appropriate mortality charges will be deducted.</li> <li>Investment Guarantee Charge- An additional 0.4% per annum for guarantee. This is the charge for providing a guarantee of 101%. In all, a very bad charge.</li> </ol> <p>Some of the charges are subject to alteration too with prior approval of IRDA.</p> <p>Service Tax is another charge which is applicable to all charges (it really is a charge by the government, and not really the insurer's fault).</p> <p>Take Away Points:</p> <ol> <li>A pension plan is a complicated product with lot of ifs and buts during the buying period. And mostly lot of disappointments for later years.</li> <li>Only 1/3 is taxfree in hand at the time of maturity.</li> <li>Rest has to be used to buy an annuity. (Alternative is create a corpus other than a pension plan, and then use it to buy the annuity, if you really find the annuity options good at the time of purchase.</li> <li>There are a lot of bad charges, which really do not give any decent advantages.</li> <li>In this particular plan, since there are no alternative funds, one does not even get the \u201csupposed benefit\u201d of switching from equity to debt. (I must say, even that benefit is really very difficult to make use of. Invariably, you will tend to shift from equity to debt at low levels and vice versa).</li> <li>Any guarantee will be charged. Any risk will be charged. Nothing is free. One needs to understand whether that guarantee / risk deferment is really worth the money or not.</li> </ol> <p>Two advantages:</p> <ol> <li>It is probably good for people who do not understand the basics of investing and want an emotional need to be satisfied by having a pension plan in their \u201cportfolio\u201d. And who have so much money, that even if their money is kept as cash, it can serve them easily.</li> <li>This plan is still better than the completely opaque non-Ulip retirement plans.</li> </ol> <p>I have specifically taken up the HDFC Life Pension Super Plus plan in this case. But, the basics of analysis will be same all across.</p> <p>Addendum: Annuity is a plan, usually by insurance companies, in which you pay a single premium and then the company in turn pays monthly/yearly amounts to you for the rest of your life (single life annuity), or your life as well your spouse's life term (joint life annuity). This amount is mostly based on the long term interest rates &amp; life expectancy of you (and your spouse). So if you are already very old, you will get more income, while if the long term interest rates are low, you will get less.</p> <p>There is an option of increasing amounts (usually 1-3% per year).</p> <p>There are some other options like cash refund (option to buy back), a fixed term of payments (like 10 years or so), etc.</p> <p>check out LIC's plan for more ideas.</p> <p>More details for understanding. http://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/annuities_basics.moneymag/index.htm</p>"},{"location":"start-here/retirement/retirement-planning/","title":"Primer on Retirement Planning","text":"<p>Original Post and Discussion</p> <p>So, you probably groaned in your head when you read the title.

The question is, are they spending more money than they used to when they weren't retired or are they spending less money?</p> <p>More often than not, you'll find that their expenses have actually reduced since their pre-retirement era. Simply because, they don't go out partying every weekend, they no longer need to spend on their children, they no longer think that over-priced coffee is the besht, they no longer feel the need to watch movies within the first week of it's release and so on and so forth.</p> <p>But then again, this differs from person to person. Some people assume that their post retirement household living expenses will only be about 70%-80% of their pre-retirement household expenses. Not a bad assumption IMO.</p> <p>So, going with this assumption, suppose you currently spend about Rs. 20,000/- per month on stuff like groceries and utilities, etc, assuming you'll only need 80% of your expenses, when you retire about 30 years from now, you'll be spending about Rs. 16,000/- only, right?</p> <p>Wrong again! \"Accept certain inalienable truths...prices will rise, politicians will Philander, you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were young prices were reasonable, politicians were noble and children respected their elders.\" (In case you are wondering why that sounds familiar, it's from the legendary song called Sunscreen by Baz Luhrmann)</p> <p>What I am trying to say is, you will have to factor in INFLATION<sup>INFLATION</sup>INFLATION^INFLATION. The amount of stuff you can buy for Rs.100/- today will be a lot less 30 years from now. Inflation Rate in India averaged 9.83 Percent from 2012 until 2014, reaching an all time high of 11.16 Percent in November of 2013 and a record low of 7.55 Percent in January of 2012. Ceteris Paribus, let us assume that over the next 30 years the average inflation rate is 8%, then, to maintain the same level of expenses of Rs. 20,000 per month, 30 years from now, you will need to spend about Rs. 2,00,000/- PER MONTH. (You can do the math yourself using the FV formula in MS Excel. Rate will be the expected annual inflation rate, nper will be the number of years left to your retirement, PV or present value will be your present expenses).</p> <p>I am not sure what salary hikes are like in your industry/company, but for people like me who are in banking, if you are an average to above average performer, assuming you work continuously, chances are that your salary will rise in tandem with the inflation. In which case, you don't have to panic as much. People tend to shift jobs every few years and get an average hike of about 25% at every jump. This will hopefully keep your income above the inflation line. But let us assume that you are an average joe and that you won't be jumping around much. How the hell are you going to maintain your lifestyle once you are retired? Plan my friend. Plan!</p> <p>You need to figure out your required retirement corpus and start building towards it. Assuming you have a life expectancy of 75 years, this corpus of yours should be able to support you for approximately 20 years past your retirement.</p> <p>I hope I didn't scare you. Did I scare you?

Employees Provident Fund","text":"<p>You are probably already in on this. Read on to understand how it works.</p> <p>There are several crucial aspects about EPF that many would not know. For instance, there are two elements to EPF - EPF and Employees' Pension Scheme (EPS). The 12 per cent employee contribution goes to EPF. However, the employer's contribution is divided in 8.33 per cent that goes in EPS, subject to a maximum of Rs 541 a month. The rest goes to EPF.</p> <p>Features</p> <p>Interest rate: Interest rate on EPF deposits for 2013-14 is 8.75% (as announced on Jan 13, 2014). The compound interest is provided only on EPF part. The EPS part (8.33% out of 12% contribution from your employer) does not get any interest.</p> <p>Tenure: You contribute till you retire and then get the pension. An employee is eligible to earn pension only on attaining 58 years of age, after completing 10 years of service. Or, on having contributed to it for 20 years. In either case, the pensionable service or number of years of contribution are increased by two years. For instance, one has attained 58 years and contributed for 25 years. Then, the pensionable service will be taken as 27 years. Or, if contributed for 20 years, then also it will be considered as 27 years.</p> <p>Maturity type?: Lumpsum/Pension</p> <p>Minimum and Maximum Investment: You can always invest more than 12% of your basic salary in EPF which is called VPF. In this case the excess amount will be invested in EPF and you will keep on getting the interest, but the employer is not supposed to match your contribution. He will just invest upto maximum of 12% of your basic, not more than that.</p> <p>Tax Benefit?: Yes. The employer contribution is exempt from tax, while an employee\u2019s contribution is taxable but eligible for deduction under Section 80C of Income tax Act. The money which you initially invest in EPF, the interest you earn and, finally the money you withdraw after a specified period (5 years), are all exempt from income tax. Withdrawal from an EPF amount is subject to tax if it is carried out within 5 years of employment with the same employer. However, if you have not worked for at least five years with the same employer but the EPF has been transferred to the new employer, it is not taxed.</p> <p>NRI Friendly?: Nope. It is applicable to employees working in India for Indian firms wonly.</p> <p>Loan facility?: Nope. But you can withdraw.</p> <p>Withdrawal facility?: Yes. But only in the following conditions:</p> <ol> <li>Marriage or education of self, children or siblings</li> <li>Medical treatment for Self or family (spouse, children, dependent parents)</li> <li>Repay a housing loan for a house in the name of self, spouse or owned jointly.</li> <li>Alterations/repairs to an existing home for house in the name of self, spouse or jointly.</li> <li>Construction or purchase of house or flat/site or plot for self or spouse or joint ownership</li> </ol> <p>These are all subject to various unique conditions each.</p> <p>How to?: Well, your HR will take care of that.</p> <p>Here is an online EPF maturity calculator</p> <p>and here are some FAQs</p>"},{"location":"start-here/retirement/studies-of-long-term-portfolios-and-retirement-withdrawal-rate-suggestions/","title":"Studies of Long Term Portfolios and Retirement Withdrawal Rate Suggestions","text":"<p>This analysis gives you a basic idea about the historical and current perspectives of institutions which manage money on a large scale. And because the world economy is increasingly getting unified (as compared to past), these ideas will be applicable on a principle basis. Hence, this idea is important as far as the basic strategy is concerned.</p> <p>However, how it applies tactically in individual cases and in an Indian context will be different.</p> <p>eg. many people think that since we can get 8-9% tax-free and guaranteed on govt securities (govt backing is as close to guarantee as one can get), we need not think about all this 3.5-4.0% withdrawal rates. But they forget the basic difference between a nominal return of 8-9% versus a inflation-adjusted real return. After 10 years, the same 8-9% nominal return will not be sufficient AT ALL in most cases. A lot of pension plans also show you similar things and make the income look big but it is not so.</p> <p>It really is a tough thing when you realise in these examples that even the best of the institutions with tremendous money power (and knowledge) cannot have a very high sustainable rate.</p> <p>The various endowment reports studied:</p> <p>I. Nobel Prize Committee Financial management Link</p> <p>The real return (above inflation) expected from the fund is 3.5% (while they plan to use 3.0% at least yearly). They have considered an allocation of 55% (+/- 10) to equities, 20% (+/-10) to fixed income and 25%(+/-10) to alternative investments (including hedge funds and real estate).</p> <p>II. Yale Endowment Portfolio Management Link</p> <p>They expect a real return of 4.5%. The main difference from above is that they indulge in lot of alterative assets and active management strategies (with alpha). A good case in point was in 2008 period, when they went too far in their strategy and were having a negative 1.5-2% in cash, and suddenly during the crisis, they were in a severe bind. So now they have corrected that part and keep a decent amount of cash with them.</p> <p>III. Norwegian govt sovereign fund Analysis Link They expect a return of 4% and unlike the endowment funds, they do not put anything into alternative asset classes. They follow simple 60:40 rule with regular rebalancing and following cost-effective strategies (read passive investing).</p> <p>Many of the online calculators have used 4% as a reasonable withdrawal rate for 30 year periods using Monte-carlo calculators. However, based on various rolling data periods of actual market returns for US equity markets, a 4% withdrawal rate will not sustain for 30 year periods in 30-40% cases (whatever be the asset allocation). At 5% withdrawal rate, the failure rate over 30 year periods increases to 40-55%. While at 3.5%, it falls to &lt;10% unless one is in 100% bonds or 100% equities.</p> <p>Why Monte-carlo is not the right thing? because the random number generation in those simulations is normal distribution curve related (while the actual returns are never like those).</p> <p>Why US equity market data? Since that data is long and reasonably good and since it is the most important economy in the increasingly globalised world, it mirrors capital markets to a large extent.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/retirement/why-you-should-not-opt-for-a-readymade-pension-plan/","title":"Why You should not Opt for a Readymade Pension Plan","text":"<p>One of my friends recently met a smart young supposedly \u201cIRDA approved financial consultant\u201d who gave him an overview of investing into a retirement plan (and which was not a Ulip, in his words). I was merely an observer.</p> <p>He gave him nice descriptions about the plan, and how that will be the best thing for his retirement and how he can then enjoy the best things in life automatically (only and only) if he invests in that plan. Awesome idea. Their fund management team had worked fabulously, and provided 15% returns on balanced funds (balanced funds = funds which can invest in both equities and debt). And implied in the response was that they will continue to do that for all the coming years. Great thing indeed again.</p> <p>My friend asked \u201cHow much will this cost to me?\u201d. Sir, around 2.5% are the total management charges. Hmm. That sounds decent.</p> <p>Next question \u201cHow much will I have to invest?\u201d. Sir, if you can tell us how much will you need, then we can tell you. Or you can mail us directly about that and we can get back to you with specific numbers. Fair enough.</p> <p>After the talk, my friend asked for the brochure, and asked them to wait for his call after a week. In any investment plan, delay the hurry.</p> <p>So here comes my analysis from the Brochure.</p> <p>\u201cIn this policy, the investment risk in Investment Portfolio is Borne by the Policyholder\u201d. In big bright bold letters. Inf= Ok. Good, they had told him but with an oral implication of 15% returns.</p> <p>Then comes a slew of good things and offers. Blah Blah.</p> <p>\u201cIn this plan, your premium, net of premium allocation charges, will be invested in an exclusive Pension Fund. At the end of the policy term, you will receive higher of the following \u2013 Fund Value or Assured Benefit of 101% of all premiums (including top-up premiums). Inf= So, the guarantee is what one pays over all the years. And they will add 1% to the total principal and return it as the guarantee. Even this is not free and comes with its own charge.</p> <p>Your maturity benefit will be used to provide you with post-retirement income i.e. an annuity which you have to purchase from us. Oh. The advisors had already told him that he can get UPTO 33% of that amount as cash, while rest has to be used for annuity or have to pay tax on that.</p> <p>If there is unfortunate demise of the policyholder, then the nominee will get the death benefit. This is Higher of 1. Fund value or 2. Total premiums paid plus interest @ 6% per year. And of course, if the fund value is less than the alternative total value, then the company will deduct mortality charges, based upon the age of the policy holder (more the age, more will be the mortality charges).</p> <p>Then there is a slew of different options, most of which I do not think I have any idea. Eg:</p> <ol> <li>Plan your maturity age. How is one supposed to plan the retirement age, will it be 55,60,65 or 70.</li> <li>Retirement needs. Which are extremely difficult to assess. Too many variables.</li> </ol> <p>Investment Fund- The fund in this case is a single fund, which is a balanced fund with a max of equity of 60%. Actually, this is not a bad option for a short-to-medium term (say 8-10 years). But for a period of 20-30 years, this restriction is a bad option.</p> <p>There is no information regarding the investment team (who are they, how many, how long is their experience, etc. How has the performance been).</p> <p>Then there are standard clauses regarding the investment fund and benefits (which I have already enumerated above). One important thing is again, the investment risk is borne by the policyholder (which means, if the fund value goes down, ultimately it is the policy holder's responsibility only).</p> <p>Some special considerations:</p> <p>Policy Discontinuance- Upto 5 years, if the policy is not paid continuously, the money will get transferred to a Discontinued Policy fund, which will get a princely savings account interest rate of the biggest bank of India (SBI) \u2013 currently 4% - minus the discontinued policy fund charge of 0.5%. Amazing.</p> <p>After 5 years, if one does not pay, then it will get an automatic surrender and the fund value will be paid back.</p> <p>At Maturity: Apart from 1/3 of the fund value taxfree cash, I will HAVE to buy an annuity from this company (or probably from other companies too). The various annuity plans have different monthly/ yearly amounts depending upon the prevailing long term interest rates, type of annuity and the company's analysis of the policyholder's longetivity (again too many variables to even give a decent approximation). So, even if they look lip-smacking (7-9%) at current rates, they may not be so 10-20 years down the line. Let us analyze this a little further. A 7-9% annuity rate may appear to be good, but if you realise that the amount provided is FIXED for the term of annuity, then that means at an inflation rate of 7-10%, this FIXED amount will start to look small within 5-10 years. And I am not even speaking about 20-30 years down the line. The purchasing power will diminish rapidly later on and this supposedly decent amount will look like a small amount later on.</p> <p>A Look at Charges:</p> <ol> <li>Premium Allocation Charges. 2.5%. So out of every 100, 2.5 will be cut and never invested at all. Why? Do not know. Compare this to normal mutual funds \u2013 zero. Of course, this charge will continue for 1-10 years, and 11th year onwards, they will give me 102.5% of my premium. Which means they will add an extra 2.5% and invest that amount. Good. But a 2.5% cut in first year does not match with a 2.5% addition in later years. Then some plans are said to be for 10 years only. Even the top up premiums get a 1% deduction. Absolutely horrible.</li> <li>Policy Admin Charges. 0.4% per month of Premium. So that means, about 5% (12x0.4=4.8) of the premium will be deducted in administering my policy over and above the normal fund charges.</li> <li>Mortality Charges- If the fund value is less than the alternative mortality benefit (premiums @ 6% value), then a corresponding amount of life cover will be given and the appropriate mortality charges will be deducted.</li> <li>Investment Guarantee Charge- An additional 0.4% per annum for guarantee. This is the charge for providing a guarantee of 101%. In all, a very bad charge.</li> </ol> <p>Some of the charges are subject to alteration too with prior approval of IRDA.</p> <p>Service Tax is another charge which is applicable to all charges (it really is a charge by the government, and not really the insurer's fault).</p> <p>Take Away Points:</p> <ol> <li>A pension plan is a complicated product with lot of ifs and buts during the buying period. And mostly lot of disappointments for later years.</li> <li>Only 1/3 is taxfree in hand at the time of maturity.</li> <li>Rest has to be used to buy an annuity. (Alternative is create a corpus other than a pension plan, and then use it to buy the annuity, if you really find the annuity options good at the time of purchase.</li> <li>There are a lot of bad charges, which really do not give any decent advantages.</li> <li>In this particular plan, since there are no alternative funds, one does not even get the \u201csupposed benefit\u201d of switching from equity to debt. (I must say, even that benefit is really very difficult to make use of. Invariably, you will tend to shift from equity to debt at low levels and vice versa).</li> <li>Any guarantee will be charged. Any risk will be charged. Nothing is free. One needs to understand whether that guarantee / risk deferment is really worth the money or not.</li> </ol> <p>Two advantages:</p> <ol> <li>It is probably good for people who do not understand the basics of investing and want an emotional need to be satisfied by having a pension plan in their \u201cportfolio\u201d. And who have so much money, that even if their money is kept as cash, it can serve them easily.</li> <li>This plan is still better than the completely opaque non-Ulip retirement plans.</li> </ol> <p>I have specifically taken up the HDFC Life Pension Super Plus plan in this case. But, the basics of analysis will be same all across.</p> <p>Addendum: Annuity is a plan, usually by insurance companies, in which you pay a single premium and then the company in turn pays monthly/yearly amounts to you for the rest of your life (single life annuity), or your life as well your spouse's life term (joint life annuity). This amount is mostly based on the long term interest rates &amp; life expectancy of you (and your spouse). So if you are already very old, you will get more income, while if the long term interest rates are low, you will get less.</p> <p>There is an option of increasing amounts (usually 1-3% per year).</p> <p>There are some other options like cash refund (option to buy back), a fixed term of payments (like 10 years or so), etc.</p> <p>check out LIC's plan for more ideas.</p> <p>More details for understanding. http://money.cnn.com/retirement/guide/annuities_basics.moneymag/index.htm</p>"},{"location":"start-here/zero-to-investing/","title":"Zero to Investing","text":"<p>WARNING: This section of the wiki needs an overhaul and the information presented in this section may not be up to date or reflect the current state of affairs.

Rather than someone who is about to start.</p> <p>Bank Account: The earned amount is sitting in the savings account and earning a measly 3%-3.5% (tax free up to 10-15,000 \u2013 whatever govt has limited, as such the amount is small). This money is relatively safe. Relatively, because in today\u2019s world of online banking and debit cards, the risk is non-zero.</p> <p>So where to start?</p> <p>Let us first understand some basics:</p> <p>Savings Options are FD/RD (Fixed Deposit / Recurring Deposit), NSC (National Savings Certificate), PPF (Public Provident Fund), private companies FD (like Shriram finance, Bajaj Finance, and others) and mutual funds categories which deal with bonds (also known as debt papers).</p> <p>All these are called Debt instruments. Basically, you give your money (called principal amount) to the other party (govt, bank, private company), and they promise to give a certain percentage of returns over and above the principal amount. So, you give them P (principal) and then give back P + I (principal and interest) after a period of time.</p> <p>An example of FD: you give the bank 10,000 today. And the bank promises to give you 10,000 and 7% (700) after 1 year.</p> <p>An example of RD: you give the bank 1,000 every month, and the bank promises to give you 12,000 (1,000 x 12 months) and around 400 additionally as interest. This is back of the envelop calculation.</p> <p>Moreover, you have to pay income tax on those 700 and 400 rs. Just try to understand how difficult it is to earn money on the savings amounts and which when subjected to tax, comes out to how little. In this case, if you are in 30% bracket, then you are getting only 490 and 280 rs finally, after you have saved that amount of money for 1 year.</p> <p>The corollary is since you have not been investing at all, you are not even getting that amount till now. Not even those measly 490 and 280 even all these years.</p> <p>I will cut short the other options, because they are as pathetic for someone of your condition.</p> <p>The \u201cbest\u201d option right now to move that money out of the rut is to put majority of money into a liquid mutual fund.</p> <p>Why that thing? Because they are:</p> <ul> <li>Diversified Basically, Liquid MFs keep money into a large number of different areas, so that if one area goes bad (recent news like IL&amp;FS, or CoVid crash), then your entire corpus is not in jeopardy all at once. The more diversified the money is kept, better is the protection (this is a general rule, but there are exceptions, which we'd get to later).</li> <li>In general, you can earn more than FD, both as amount of interest as well as with less tax, ~if you keep the money in there for &gt;3 years.~ (Update: Starting from 1st April, 2023, debt funds will no longer provide long-term tax benefits if held for &gt;3 years. However, they are still better than FDs as taxes are only accrued on redemption and not annually)</li> <li>Third and most important, the money withdrawal is flexible. You want to redeem only 5,000 INR, you can. You want to take out 1L, you can (of course, you should have more than 1 lakh invested). You want to remove the entire amount and see it in your balance, you can do that as well</li> </ul> Warning <p>You will receive money only the next working day from liquid mutual fund. For smaller amounts, (&lt;50,000 INR, or 90% of your investments, whichever is smaller), most liquid MFs have the facility of 24x7 instant redemption via IMPS, which is a great thing.</p> <p>Solution: so, for that person with 24L, we advised him to keep 3L in savings account (he had been seeing that huge amount in his account statement, so just could not ask him to remove everything. It would have been a shock to him), keep three 1L FDs of similar maturity and rest 18L in ICICI Prudential liquid fund.</p> <p>We're giving a specific name here, because there are so many options in that category, that it again causes action paralysis of which one to choose.</p> <p>Other one which we can recommend is Parag Parikh liquid fund (because they have put most of their portfolio, mostly in the SOV-rated RBI papers; which if you don't know what is, know that it's the safest piece of debt instruments out there).</p> <p>From other analysis available on the internet, Quantum\u2019s liquid fund is a good idea.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/zero-to-investing/part-four-how-to-invest/","title":"Part Four - How to Invest","text":"<p>How to go about putting the money which has been allocated for savings/investing?</p> <p>How to decide how much to put where?</p> <p>We will create two categories or my preferential term Baskets (or Buckets).</p> <p>Basket 1: Money which can be needed in next 5-7 years</p> <p>Basket 2: Money which is needed after 5-7 years.</p> <p>Why 5 years?

Don\u2019t worry, they will not charge you money for that skipping.</li> <li>Why equal divisions? I am smart enough to calculate the exact ratios.

If you are not doing that, no investment plan is going to get you off the ground. You are digging a hole faster than it can be filled.</p> <p>Some more Terms:</p> <ol> <li>ATM card (=automated teller machine card). Basically, a historical thing. It was used in an ATM machine (please, I am not going to tell what an ATM machine is!!) to transact. Not available anymore, in a working condition.</li> <li>Debit card (ATM card functions plus Can be used at merchant\u2019s outlets namely stores, hotels, and online purchases). Since it has ATM card functions also, can be used freely at ATMs.</li> <li>Credit card (this is not an ATM card but can be used at merchant\u2019s outlets).</li> <li>To use in ATM machine: please use Debit card ONLY. Never a credit card.</li> <li>To use for shopping: please either use Cash or slightly prefer a credit card than a debit card. Basically, cash &gt; credit card &gt; debit card.</li> </ol> <p>How they function:</p> <p>Debit Card: your card is associated with your real bank account number. And the amount currently in your bank account is the limit for that debit card. So, if the account has 5,000 rs, then you can either withdraw cash up to 5,000 or make a shopping purchase for up to 5,000. If you accidently tried to do a shopping of 5,001, then it will be rejected on the spot.</p> <p>Credit Card: your card is associated with a virtual account, which has a limit. This limit is decided by the bank/credit card company (yes, American Express is an exclusive credit card company without an associated bank, while ICICI bank has both services). This virtual account works like a postpaid mobile bill. Whatever purchases you make are added up and you are presented a bill at the end of month. You are given 20 days to pay up that bill. If you pay within those 20 days (before last date) AND, this is really important, if you pay either the full amount or any amount more than the bill, then GREAT. You managed to use extra money from the bank at zero cost to you practically. Continue this always.</p> <p>Never pay only the Minimum Amount Due or even 1 paise below the bill amount. If you do that, you will incur heavy charges at the rate of 40% per year (which is at least 10 times your savings bank account interest rate).</p> <p>Better still, don\u2019t own a credit card till you are financially savvy enough. Use Cash and be merry.</p> <p>Rules of Thumb with all those Sales advertisements and Big Annual Sales days</p> <p>Rule 1: If you get an impulse to buy something, put a 72 hour rule between the urge to buy and the actual buy order.</p> <p>Sidenote: New scientific studies have shown that the serotoninergic receptors take up to 72 hours to absorb the excess serotonin secreted when that buying urge gets triggered. I could have linked up those studies, but then this is all just scientific mumbo-jumbo to really convince you about the 72 hour period! There isn\u2019t any such study known to me. Just kidding.</p> <p>Rule 2: Please delete all those shopping apps from your smartphone, namely amazon, flipkart, myntra, etc.</p> <p>Sidenote: You just need one app \u2013 Headspace for meditation during those buying impulses. Again just kidding.</p> <p>Rule 3: Start automated investment setups, so that your money goes away from bank account before you can even think about spending.</p> <p>Flexi Rule 4: How much to Save?</p> <p>Now that we have curtailed spending and have easy setup for investing, the basic question is how much you should save?</p> <p>The basic idea is Save as much as you Reasonably can. If that is 60-70%, good (Pattu does that, I do that). If it is 30%, well and good. If it is 10%, again decent, since it is better than 0%. Once you start seeing results of your savings, you will get better. With better incomes, and lesser spendings and more focus, the rate of savings will increase. Don't get limited on to 10%, since that is what I have seen most recommended - that amount is seriously insufficient.</p>"},{"location":"start-here/zero-to-investing/part-two-defensive-setup/","title":"Part Two - Defensive Setup","text":"<p>Now that we want to park the money into a more flexible instrument, we can proceed to next options.

Basically this is an income replacement insurance and not a \u201clife\u201d insurance. The life of a person is invaluable and cannot be replaced by money. What we want is to have a lumpsum amount of money when the bread-winner dies, which can substitute for the income lost due to his absence.</p> <p>Sidenote: Yes, in today\u2019s world, both husband and wife earn and are equal/unequal bread-winners. But because of socially accepted more responsibilities of the wife, I do feel that husband should have higher coverage than wife\u2019s. The importance of the wife in the family is so high that she cannot be replaced while I expect the husband to be more financially savvy, so if the wife dies, the husband can manage without that lumpsum due to life insurance of the wife. But if you want, have coverages for both husband and wife.</p> <p>Buy pure term insurance. In simple words, this plan/policy means that the company will pay you an amount X (called Cover amount), if the policy holder dies within a defined term (10-40 years), and for that it will ask you to pay the insurance amount (called Premium) every year. Typically, the amounts range from 500-1000x.</p> <p>Eg. If you are a 30 year old male, non-smoker, and you want a 1 crore life cover for 30 years, then you would need to pay around 10,000 a year. This makes to an amount of 3,00,000 over 30 years to be paid if the person does not die. While you die anytime from the start of the policy, then the family gets paid 1,00,00,000 (= 1 crore). If you don\u2019t die, then those 3 lakhs have gone to the insurance company and it is your loss. Please ignore this loss. Let this loss occur, since I am pretty sure, no one wants to die!</p> <p>Any other option than pure term insurance is more expensive. And ignore all such options like life return of premium, money-back, step up, step down, investment-insurance, etc. With the kind of marketing prowess of the insurance companies, there are so many terms that it is much easier to ignore all those things.</p> <p>An example of a money-back policy will be with the same conditions of 30 year old male, 30 year policy of 1 crore would have a premium of 2-3lakhs per year, yes per year.</p> <p>These days, most of the companies have some form of Direct plans in which you can buy the policy directly from the company instead of through an agent. Going through an agent usually adds up about 10-20% in the premium at the least. Prefer going direct.</p> <p>What not to do?</p> <ol> <li>Don\u2019t buy anything which is not Term insurance.</li> <li>Take the term till 60 years at max and not beyond that, even if there is an option. Basically, you don\u2019t want to continue to have a need for income replacement at 60 years. That just means that your investment plan lacks because you don\u2019t have enough money even at 60 years.</li> <li>State the details asked in an honest manner. If you are smoker, then state that. If you are hypertensive (=high blood pressure), please state that. Etc.</li> <li>If the company asks for a medical test, let them do it. If they don\u2019t ask, then don\u2019t force it.

The reasons are simple:</p> <ul> <li>The investor is more likely to be doing their own due diligence for the underlying stocks in their direct stock portfolio.</li> <li>Generally, a retail investor's stock portfolio is more concentrated than an equity fund (let alone more than one in aggregate, which seems to be the norm), so it takes less time and effort to keep track of stocks in a direct stock portfolio than stocks in an equity fund.</li> </ul> <p>Also, as Seth explains, an investor has to think in terms of both absolute, and relative returns - beating the market matters, but absolute returns are equally important; the inverse of this is also true - one may be able to reach their self-defined goals in terms of returns, but under perform the market in a bull run.</p> <p>Apart from benchmarking against the market, or self-defined goals, some investors often pick up direct stock picking for much simpler reasons - enjoying the process behind evaluating a business, and acting upon opportunities provided by the market. That is, there's a certain pleasure in doing it yourself.</p>"},{"location":"stocks/can-you-beat-the-market/#so-can-you-beat-the-market","title":"So can you beat the market?","text":"<p>Establishing the possibility of beating the market is futile if one doesn't acknowledge what it takes to do it consistently \u2014 a brutal cocktail of time, effort, discipline, conviction, contrarianism, and an investment philosophy to invest the time, effort, discipline, and conviction in.</p>"},{"location":"stocks/can-you-beat-the-market/#sticking-to-an-investment-philosophy","title":"Sticking to an investment philosophy","text":"<p>An investment philosophy can be thought of as a construct of mental models upon which the investor builds his portfolio upon. If the universe of stocks under the investor's circle of competence is chaos - an unexplored territory of potential, the investor mines out order from this chaos in the form of a portfolio, using mental models as forklifts. The lack of having an investment philosophy generally results in owning stocks that are not a perfect fit for the portfolio. As Chuck Palahniuk writes in his book,</p> <p>'If you don't know what you want, you end up with a lot you don't.'</p> <p>So, mental models help investors validate their strategy by providing a confined framework, and an investment philosophy is a set of mental models that the investor follows.

The consensus on the impact of this information is what establishes the stock price in the short run, and so if your view aligns with that of the majority, it makes sense that you'll largely make market returns - every investor can't beat the market as together they are the market. To get extraordinary returns, you need to have an extraordinary perspective. This is what Howard Marks calls second level thinking, Ben Graham calls trace of wisdom, and Warren Buffett &amp; Charlie Munger call having an edge.</p> <p>This is not to say the consensus view of information is always wrong, in all likeliness millions of other investors may be smarter and more knowledgeable than you. The idea is to find instances where the individual investor can use contrarian insight that the market isn't reflecting, and it has to be accurate, or at-least more correct than the consensus view.</p> <p>To quote Howard Marks' The Most Important Thing,</p> <p>Only if your behaviour is unconventional is your performance likely to be unconventional, and only if your judgments are superior is your performance likely to be above average. For your performance to diverge from the norm, your expectations\u2014 and thus your portfolio\u2014have to diverge from the norm, and you have to be more right than the consensus. Different and better: that\u2019s a pretty good description of second-level thinking.</p> <p>Marks also proceeds to provide a framework, a set of questions that an investor must ask when working with contrarian thinking,</p> <ul> <li>What is the range of likely future outcomes?</li> <li>Which outcome do I think will occur?</li> <li>What\u2019s the probability I\u2019m right?</li> <li>What does the consensus think?</li> <li>How does my expectation differ from the consensus?</li> <li>How does the current price for the asset comport with the consensus view of the future, and with mine?</li> <li>Is the consensus psychology that\u2019s incorporated in the price too bullish or bearish?</li> <li>What will happen to the asset\u2019s price if the consensus turns out to be right, and what if I\u2019m right?</li> </ul> <p>To sum it up, holding consensus view on any material information comes naturally to us \u2014 specially if an investor relies on financial news channels or social media to acquire information; but that's not how above average returns can be achieved, by definition consensus views largely yields market return.

Remember, the market can stay irrational for long durations of time. As Sanjay Bakshi notes in his appearance in an episode of the We Study Billionaires podcast, unlike many other professions, an investor rarely receives an immediate feedback on his operations. Sometimes it takes years for the market to catch up to intrinsic value of an asset, and so it is hard to separate luck from genuine success \u2014 so hold on to the underlying process rather than focusing on the outcome. A good handle on your conviction helps you to hang in until other investors catch up on the market's inefficiencies. On this subject, Joel Greenblatt annotates on The Most Important Thing,</p> <p>I always tell my students, \u201cIf you do a good job valuing a stock, I guarantee that the market will agree with you.\u201d I just don\u2019t tell them when. It could be weeks or years.</p> <p>Another thing to note is an investor should never rely on borrowed conviction, primarily because it's never enough to hold on to. If you don't do your own research, and rather rely on someone else's, the conviction tends to be weak, and so emotions act up, and exit plans are broken before the thesis fully appreciates.

A solar module manufacturing process is as follows,</p> <ol> <li>The company would purchase inputs in the form of semiconductors (typically Silicon), tempered glass (specialized for solar modules), silver paste, and electrodes.</li> <li>Silicon in crystalline form is melted and cast into blocks. These blocks are cut into thin wafers.</li> <li>The wafers are then used as diodes, so that charges flow in only one direction. Thus, current is generated.</li> <li>Many such wafers are combined to form a single solar cell producing about a watt of power. And, many solar cells are combined in a single solar module.</li> <li>The diodes are connected with metals, so that current can be directed out of the cells.</li> <li>To prevent the solar light from being reflected (the light reflected of course cannot be used to generate current), an antireflective coating of Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) or Silicon Nitride (SiN) is applied on the surface of cells.</li> <li>An encapsulant material (typically Ethyl Vinyl Acetate) holds together solar cells between the top surface and rear surface. The top surface is tempered glass specifically made to protect solar modules and let solar radiation pass through. The rear surface is a thin polymer back sheet (typically made of Tedlar) that prevents ingress of water and gases.</li> <li>The panel itself is typically put in a protective frame made of Aluminum.</li> <li>A junction box is used to direct electrical connections outside the Aluminum frame.</li> </ol> <p>Suppose you had bought a company that sells solar modules. If you had not studied the manufacturing/assembling pipeline, you would probably not be aware of the existence (let alone importance) of solar glass in the modules. In an event where there is shortage of solar glass in the market, the company would have to either pay extraordinary prices, or in the rare occasion, shut production. You, as an investor in the company, would be caught off guard with the margins of the company being affected.

And so, the flip side of performing due diligence is the ability to keep track of companies / sectors within your circle of competence as simply as possible. In fact, performing thorough due diligence yourself essentially allows you to abstract what's relevant in a sector, and track that. For example, with the telecom sector, much of what you need to know apart from your research is encapsulated in one number - average revenue per user (ARPU). With fast-moving consumer goods, a lot of information that you would need to keep an eye on cuts down to value/volume growth.</p> <p>Sahil Bloom, VP of Altamont Capital Partners describes this beautifully in his appearance[^19](https://www.theinvestorspodcast.com/episodes/mental-models-sahil-bloom/) on the We Study Billionaires podcast,</p> <p>Occam\u2019s razor is all about simplicity.

These costs are collectively known as Cost of Goods Sold or COGS.</p> <p>How do we define COGS though and what do directly associated costs mean? Interestingly, the answer can vary depending upon the company we're looking at. Let's look at some examples.</p> <p></p> <p>For a capital intensive company like Motherson Sumi which deals with a lot of tangible raw materials, it should be expected that the cost of materials consumed would be relatively high. Purchase of stock-in-trade measures the expenses incurred in buying products used as intermediates to create the finished products sold by the company. Change in inventories of finished goods, work-in-progress, and stock-in-trade, as the name implies, are the expenses incurred on creating the products left in the inventory of Motherson Sumi at the end of the financial year 2020.</p> <p>These costs can be considered directly associated with creating the end product. Expenses like the finance costs or depreciation &amp; amortization aren't directly related to the creation of the end product. We can ask the following question to think whether an expense qualifies as COGS \u2014 would this expense have emerged even if no sales were generated? If yes, then it probably shouldn't be included in COGS.</p> <p>The labor costs incurred to produce the end product are also direct costs eligible for inclusion in COGS. However, this should only include actual labor costs paid to employees responsible for creating the product, not employees in marketing or HR, for example. This is a conundrum because the notes for employee benefit expenses looks like this</p> <p></p> <p>We don't know the details of how much of the salary, wages, &amp; bonus are direct costs. The details are not mentioned possibly due to competitive and logistical reasons.</p> <p>We leave the decision of inclusion of employee benefit expenses in COGS up to the reader and his/her judgement which will possibly be influenced by the company in question and its nature of business. Please note that these expenses would still be reported under the operating expenses and end up getting reflected in the operating profit.</p> <p>In this case, we'll consider COGS as</p> <pre><code>COGS = Cost of Materials Consumed + Purchase of Stock-in-Trade + Changes in Inventories of Finished Goods, Work-in-Progress, and Stock-in-Trade\n</code></pre> <p>This gives us $$\u20b935,547+\u20b9710+\u20b914.5=\u20b936,271.5$$ crores.</p> <p></p> <p>Since TCS is a services company, it doesn't deal with or manufacture any raw materials or tangible goods. TCS' tangible material is its software licenses and employees who provide services worldwide. In this case, the COGS would be $$\u20b985,952+\u20b91,905=\u20b987,857$$ crores.</p> <p>Now that we know how to calculate COGS, we can calculate the gross profit.</p> <pre><code>Gross Profit = Revenue from Operations - COGS\n</code></pre> <p>Motherson Sumi's gross profit for the financial year 2020 was $$\u20b963,536.8-\u20b936,271.5=\u20b927,265.3$$ crores.

Although PBT doesn't get the same amount of focus as gross profit, operating profit, and net profit do, it can still be useful in its own right. Corporate taxation laws can change and this can end up skewing the net profit that a company earns in a financial year. For example, India slashed its corporate tax rates (archive.org link | archive.is link) for domestic companies from $$30\\%$$ to $$22\\%$$ in September 2019.

We can use this metric to judge how well a company utilizes their assets to generate profits. It can be calculated by using the following formula:</p> <pre><code>Return on Assets = Profit after Taxes / Total Assets\n</code></pre> <p>Just like ROE, we can use average total assets instead of just total assets when needed to calculate ROA.</p> <p>The ROE of Avenue Supermarts for the year 2020 is $$15.6\\%$$ and the ROA is</p> <p>$$\\displaystyle \\frac{\u20b91,300.98}{\\displaystyle \\frac{\u20b912,076.45+\u20b97,005.72}{2}}=13.6\\%$$</p> <p>Even though ROE is a popular metric, it's important to understand its quirks and limitations.

As you might have suspected, these ROE figures are misleading (but not incorrect). We'll attempt to showcase the limitations of ROE as a financial ratio and why it should be used with caution in cases where the net profit is negative or when the company is in significant debt.</p> <p>Besides the definition that we shared above, ROE and ROA can be expressed using the DuPont Identity, also known as the DuPont Method, which breaks down ROE and ROA into several ratios and presents us with a detailed and an alternative view.</p> <p>According to the DuPont method, ROE can be written as</p> <pre><code>Return on Equity = Profitability Ratio x Efficiency Ratio x Leverage Ratio\n</code></pre> <p>Profitability Ratio is the PAT margin we've seen before. The Efficiency Ratio is <code>Total Income / Average Assets</code> and the Leverage Ratio is <code>Average Assets / Average Shareholders Equity</code>. If you observe closely, the DuPont Identity gives back the original definition we shared if we cancel out the relevant numerators and denominators from the above formula. However, by breaking up ROE into 3 different ratios, we can now know how the ROE figures of Bombay Dyeing ended up getting inflated.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Let's start with the year 2019. We can break down Bombay Dyeing's ROE as follows:</p> <p>Profitability Ratio = $$\\displaystyle \\frac{\u20b91,228.21}{\u20b94,469.98}=0.27$$</p> <p>Efficiency Ratio = $$\\displaystyle \\frac{\u20b94,469.98}{\\displaystyle \\frac{\u20b95,180.65+\u20b94,146.81}{2}}=0.95$$</p> <p>Leverage Ratio = $$\\displaystyle \\frac{\\displaystyle \\frac{\u20b95,180.65+\u20b94,146.81}{2}}{\\displaystyle \\frac{\u20b9182.47+\u20b9636.88}{2}}=11.38$$</p> <p>Return on Equity = $$0.27\\times 0.95\\times 11.38=291\\%$$</p> <p>The difference of $$8\\%$$ may be ignored because ratios were rounded to 2 decimal places.</p> <p>Although the profitability ratio and efficiency ratio (also known as asset turnover ratio) are decent, what ends up inflating ROE is the leverage ratio (also known as equity multiplier) which indicates that Bombay Dyeing's assets are mostly funded through debt rather than equity which is a point of concern.</p> <p>Let's assume a hypothetical company called A Ltd. Its accounting equation looks like $$10=8+2$$ where assets are 10, equity is 8, and liabilities are 2. Its leverage ratio is $$\\frac{10}{8}=1.25$$. A Ltd decides to take on $$20$$ units of loan to finance its operations. The equation now looks like $$30=8+22$$. The financial leverage now becomes $$\\frac{30}{8}=3.75$$. This would end up inflating the ROE of A Ltd but that doesn't necessarily mean that its a good thing. Taking on a lot of debt may or may not pay off. If, however, the profitability ratio and efficiency ratio increase in the subsequent financial years, taking on debt could be considered a worthwhile decision.</p> <p>The DuPont formula for ROE ends up revealing ROA as well when we multiply the Profitability Ratio with the Efficiency Ratio. This means that ROA is a function of a firm's profitability and its asset turnover capability.</p> <p>Besides the highlighted limitations in this section, the usual caveats apply. ROA and ROE are best compared against firms in the same sector with similar business models.</p>"},{"location":"stocks/financial-metrics-and-ratios/profitability/#return-on-capital-employed-roce","title":"Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)","text":"<p>Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) is a measure of how much money can a company generate in the form of profits considering the amount of money invested in it for the long term.</p> <p>After reading that definition, one might think, how do we calculate the \"amount of money invested in a company for the long term\"?</p> <p>Let's say you decide to buy a house worth $$\u20b950$$ lakh.

Instead of looking at capital employed, how about we consider the capital invested in a business? After all, the ability to generate cash isn't the only thing that matters. A company sitting on huge amounts of cash isn't necessarily a good thing since the returns generated from that cash is not going to exceed the cost of capital employed and the expected returns by shareholders. We'd want a company to make use of that cash effectively and grow its business better than its competitors. Efficient capital allocation matters just as much, if not more, than how capital is employed and it is one of the most important responsibilities of the management of a company. Its importance is perhaps best highlighted by the following excerpt from Warren Buffet's 1987 letter to shareholders.</p> <p>The heads of many companies are not skilled in capital allocation. Their inadequacy is not surprising. Most bosses rise to the top because they have excelled in an area such as marketing, production, engineering, administration or, sometimes, institutional politics. Once they become CEOs, they face new responsibilities. They now must make capital allocation decisions, a critical job that they may have never tackled and that is not easily mastered.</p> <p>In the end, plenty of unintelligent capital allocation takes place in corporate America. (That's why you hear so much about \"restructuring.\") Berkshire, however, has been fortunate. At the companies that are our major non-controlled holdings, capital has generally been well-deployed and, in some cases, brilliantly so.</p> <p>The Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), also known simply as Return on Capital (ROC), is the measure of profit generated by a company relative to the amount of capital invested in its business.</p> <p>Okay, so how do we define what capital invested is?</p> <p>We defined capital employed as <code>Shareholders Equity + Non-current Liabilities</code> but it can also be written as <code>Total Assets - Current Liabilities</code> using the operational approach. We can exclude</p> <ul> <li> <p>cash and cash equivalents, bank balances, term deposits, and interest</p> <p>income from cash</p> </li> <li> <p>goodwill</p> </li> <li> <p>unusual and one-time items</p> </li> </ul> <p>Excess cash sitting in a bank or in debt funds isn't invested in a business and isn't an operational asset. Goodwill is an intangible asset usually resulting from the acquisition of a company at a premium value. We exclude goodwill because it is the leftover premium from the past, not an investment for future growth. Similarly, other one-time items like asset write downs aren't included in the capital invested since they are not core operational assets.</p> <p>This gives us</p> <pre><code>Non-operational Assets = Cash and Cash Equivalents - Goodwill - Misc One Time Items\nCapital Invested = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Non-operational Assets\n</code></pre> <p>This gives the denominator in the formula for ROIC. Since we are focusing on the invested capital from an operational standpoint, we'll use operational profit in the numerator. However, instead of using just EBIT, we'll adjust EBIT for taxes to get a more standardized version of operating income. This is known as net operating profit after taxes (NOPAT).</p> <p>ROIC can now be defined as</p> <pre><code>NOPAT = EBIT x (1 - tax rate)\nCapital Invested = Total Assets - Current Liabilities - Non-operational Assets\nROIC = NOPAT / Capital Invested\n</code></pre> <p>There's another caveat we should keep in mind when calculating ROIC. The NOPAT generated at the end of a financial year won't be because of capital invested at the end of the same financial year. To account for this timing difference, the amount of capital invested used in calculating ROIC will be as it was at the end of the preceding financial year.</p> <p>Let's start with Abbott India. The EBIT for the year 2020 was $$\u20b9696.8$$ crores. The tax rate can be considered as $$25.17\\%$$ as mentioned in Note 18 of the financial statements. This gives us a NOPAT of</p> <p>NOPAT = $$\u20b9696.8\\times (1-25.17\\%)=\u20b9521.4$$ crores</p> <p></p> <p>The capital invested of Abbott India for the year 2019 is</p> <p>Cash and Cash Equivalents (Note 10) = $$\u20b9137$$ crores</p> <p>Term Deposits (Note 11) = $$\u20b91,542.07$$ crores</p> <p>Interest on Bank Deposits (Note 13) = $$\u20b927.13$$ crores</p> <p>Non-operational Assets = $$\u20b9137+\u20b91,542.07+\u20b927.13=\u20b91,706.2$$ crores</p> <p>Capital Invested = $$\u20b92,940.91-\u20b9856.89-\u20b91,706.2=\u20b9377.82$$ crores</p> <p></p> <p>This gives us a ROIC of $$\\frac{\u20b9521.4}{\u20b9377.8}=138\\%$$. The ROIC of Pfizer India for the year 2020 is $$\\frac{\u20b9351.1}{\u20b9603.8}=58.1\\%$$.</p> <p>Motherson Sumi, an auto ancillary company which is significantly more capital intensive, has a ROIC of $$9.82\\%$$ for the year 2020. Of course, this doesn't mean we can compare Motherson's ROIC with Abbott's. An appropriate comparison would be with a company like Minda Corporation which is also a capital intensive auto ancillary company. It's ROIC for the year 2020 was $$\\frac{\u20b998.7}{\u20b9761.7}=12.9\\%$$. One may notice that although Minda Corporation had a negative PAT for the year 2020, its operational profit was positive. The reason for the negative PAT seems to an exceptional event which is not considered when calculating ROIC.</p> <p></p> <p>Of course, like any other ratio, ROIC has its limitations.</p> <p>ROIC, and its constituents, are non-standard metrics that we may not find anywhere in an annual report. We have to calculate NOPAT and Capital Invested ourselves, manually, to avoid mistakes and incorrect calculations. Although we considered the timing difference when calculating capital invested, some stock screening websites may not do so and use capital invested at the end of the year in question which is incorrect.</p> <p>ROIC can also mislead investors into preferring asset light companies with relatively higher ROIC than asset heavy companies with relatively lower ROIC.</p> <ul> <li>How Return on Equity is Deceiving You (archive.org link | archive.is link)</li> <li>Return on Assets So Useful ... and so Misused (archive.org link | archive.is link)</li> <li>Warren Buffet's 1987 Letter to Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway (archive.org link | archive.is link)</li> <li>ROC, ROIC, and ROE: Measurement and Implications (archive.org link | archive.is link)</li> <li>Return on Invested Capital: How to Get It Right (archive.org link | archive.is link)</li> <li>Questions About ROIC &amp; Valuation (archive.org link | archive.is link)</li> </ul>"},{"location":"stocks/under-progress/","title":"Work in Progress","text":"Danger <p>Content in these pages are being worked upon, and not yet ready for publishing.

This metric is known as Days Sales of Inventory (DSI). It is also known as Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO). DSI can be calculated using the following formula</p> <pre><code>Days Sales of Inventory = 365 / Inventory Turnover Ratio\n</code></pre> <p>For Avenue Supermarts, the DSI turns out to be <code>365 / 11.8 = 30 days</code>.

It gives us an overview of a company\u2019s capital structure by measuring the amount of employed debt against equity.</p> <p>The Debt to Equity ratio can be defined as</p> <pre><code>Debt to Equity Ratio = Total Debt / Shareholders Equity\n</code></pre> <p>We\u2019ll consider total debt as the sum of financial obligations which bear interest and lease liabilities. This includes current and non-current borrowings, lease liabilities, current maturities of long term debt and lease obligations, and any other liabilities that can bear interest. We will NOT consider trade payables, provisions, and deferred tax liabilities for calculating the total debt. Keeping this in mind, we can define total debt as,</p> <pre><code>Total Debt = Current Borrowings + Non-current Borrowings + Lease Liabilities + Current Maturities of Long Term Debt and Lease Liabilities + Other Interest Bearing Obligations\n</code></pre> <p>We can also restrict total debt to non-current borrowings and other interest bearing non-current financial obligations only depending upon the company we\u2019re analyzing. In such cases, we\u2019re primarily concerned with the non-current financial obligations of the company in comparison to the shareholders equity.</p> <p>We\u2019ve already defined shareholders equity before as total assets minus total liabilities. It can also be found on the balance sheet in an annual report.</p> <p></p> <p>Let\u2019s consider the balance sheet of an infrastructure and construction company \u2014 Larsen &amp; Toubro.</p> <p>The total debt can be calculated as <code>\u20b935,021.02 + \u20b923,654.77 + \u20b982,331.33 + \u20b91,741.6 + \u20b9424.95 = \u20b91,43,173 crores</code>. The Shareholders Equity is <code>\u20b9280.78 + \u20b966,442.44 + \u20b99,520.83 = \u20b976,244.05 crores</code>. This gives us a debt to equity ratio of <code>\u20b91,43,173 / \u20b976,244.05 = 1.87</code>.</p> Info <p>Although we\u2019ve included lease liabilities in our calculation, not being able to pay lease obligations may not have the same impact as not paying loan obligations. We can exclude lease obligations from the numerator to get a debt to equity ratio of <code>1.84</code>.</p> <p>A debt to equity ratio of <code>1.87</code> tells us that for every \u20b91 in shareholders equity, Larsen &amp; Toubro has <code>\u20b91.87</code> in debt.</p> <p>Usually, a higher value of debt to equity ratio indicates higher insolvency risk compared to another company with a lower value. Although this may be correct but the assumption that comes attached \u2014 a company with a higher debt to equity ratio is unequivocally not going to stay solvent - isn\u2019t always true. This is because a company\u2019s financial ability to cater to its debt obligations needn\u2019t be stuck solely in shareholder\u2019s equity.</p> <p>As we\u2019ve said before, ratios are meaningless when looked at in isolation. Let\u2019s calculate the debt to equity ratio of another construction company, Reliance Infrastructure Ltd.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>We\u2019ve showcased Note 11(d) from Reliance Infra\u2019s financial statements because it contains figures for the premium payable to National Highways Authority of India (NHAI). According to this ET article, NHAI premiums are payments made by construction companies to NHAI in build, operate, and transfer (BOT) projects. We\u2019re considering NHAI premiums as a component of total debt.</p> <p>The total debt can be calculated as</p> <p><code>\u20b911,758.86 + \u20b92,541.37 + \u20b92,765.28 + (\u20b9272.31 + \u20b92,206.92) + \u20b913.98 + \u20b967.61 = \u20b919,626.33</code></p> <p>and the shareholders equity is <code>\u20b911,621.82 crores</code> which gives us a debt to equity ratio of <code>1.68</code>.</p> <p>Note that comparing the debt to equity ratio of companies from different sectors or industries isn\u2019t helpful and often misleading. Simply put, different sectors, or industries, have different operational and financial aspects. IT companies are generally cash rich and don\u2019t require a lot of capital compared to construction companies so it makes sense that the debt to equity ratio of IT companies would be lower than that of banks &amp; non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) whose business model depends entirely on borrowing money from one entity and loaning it to another.</p> <p>Another thing to keep in mind is that companies at different stages of their business cycle may have varied debt to equity ratios, so comparing their values may not be perfectly intuitive. One company may be in its expansion stage while another may be focusing on winding down its debt. Companies of different scales may also yield varied debt to equity ratios. This is because cost of debt is often dependent on a company\u2019s size and can affect a company\u2019s decision to take on more or less debt.</p> <ul> <li>National National Highways Authority of India allows premium rejig for 9 highway developers | archive.org link | archive.is link</li> </ul>"},{"location":"stocks/under-progress/understanding-the-business-of-a-company/","title":"Diving Deeper into Businesses","text":"<p>In the previous chapter, we noted that as individual investors, our job is to find and exploit disparities between market and intrinsic values of businesses. Further, we explored a way to build a universe of companies to study and track based on sectoral categorization.</p> <p>But, a mechanical study of sectors will only take you so far. Sure, we've gathered qualitative information and numbers associated with a sector based on a generic understanding, but that doesn't cut it.</p> <p>As we noted in our introductory chapter, we require extraordinary perspective to consistently get extraordinary returns. Of course, gaining extraordinary perspective requires an analytical (and not mechanical) understanding of a business. We've touched on this a fair bit whenever we've referred to the phrase circle of competence, but let us dive a bit deeper into this mental model.</p> <p>The essence of it can be found in Berkshire Hathaway's 1996 edition of Letter to the Shareholders in which Warren Buffett says,</p> <p>Intelligent investing is not complex, though that is far from saying that it is easy. What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word \"selected\": You don't have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.</p> <p>Pretty straightforward - invest only in businesses you understand.</p> <p>Note that Buffett has used the word businesses, not products; it's a common misconception of the mental model that Buffett was referring to understanding the value a product adds to the life of its consumer. That would have been far more inclusive, most products are simple enough to understand. Instead, it is the economics of the business that needs to be understood and reasonably predicted.</p> <p>Another misinterpretation of the model is that we're stuck with what we know, and that's that. This may be due to the phrasing often associated with discussions regarding the model, the purpose of which is not to discourage one from expanding your circle, only to be cautious of staying in your circle, whatever it is during the time you're making an investment decision. Sahil Bloom, in his appearance in We Study Billionaires podcast explains this delicate balance beautifully,</p> <p>I really would impress upon people that your circle should grow, it should shrink, it should morph into different areas as you learn, and as you grow. The whole point is you need to be a continuous learner, and go down the rabbit hole on things that you\u2019re excited about. [...] the reality is, life is dynamic. The world is dynamic, situations change. You need to be constantly learning and trying to grow your circle of competence over time. I think that\u2019s point number one is the circle of competence should be dynamic, you should be striving to build it. The other point is you need to be absolutely ruthless in identifying the boundaries of it throughout. So, you can be striving to grow your circle of competence. But if you haven\u2019t spent the time and really put in the energy and effort for it to have effectively grown, you need to be cognizant of that fact and not start reaching because you think you know everything that\u2019s outside of it.</p> <p>It all circles back / seamlessly connects with the other mental model we've talked about above, having an edge. A good enough amalgamation of this union is - its smart to use the limited extraordinary insights we have of the businesses we economically understand than to dabble in businesses we don't economically understand. This is because what we know of businesses we don't economically understand is probably common knowledge, and is thus probably priced in.</p> <p>The reason we've explained this in a segue between the two chapters is to make sure you're not falling into an information gathering hole. Researching a sector or a business is important, but really understanding the economics of it (in a way in which your insights are better than the market's) is something that can't be taught. Howard Marks' in the introductory chapter of his book 'The Most Important Thing' warns of this rather bluntly,</p> <p>In basketball, they say, \u201cYou can\u2019t coach height,\u201d meaning all the coaching in the world won\u2019t make a player taller. It\u2019s almost as hard to teach insight.</p> <p>If Howard Marks' can't help you learn how to find an edge, we certainly can't. We can only guide you in the rudimentary processes involved in due-diligence.</p> <p>Anyway, let's move on and see what due-diligence is required while researching a business.</p>"},{"location":"stocks/under-progress/understanding-the-business-of-a-company/#a-framework-for-business-analysis","title":"A framework for Business Analysis","text":"<p>While studying a business, there are a few things you want to look at,</p> <ul> <li>Key events in the company's history</li> <li>Value proposition of the company's products</li> <li>Business model of the company</li> <li>Competition faced by the company</li> <li>Risks &amp; Threats to the company's business</li> </ul> <p>We're going to cover the questions under these broad themes that need to be covered while studying a business, with examples wherever we feel it is necessary to better illustrate our point.

While lower ARPU would intuitively mean lower profitability, Jio understood that it had to do this to gain customers. Net-net, it worked out as a good strategy for Jio, while many other players either shut shop, or took a serious financial hit.</p> <p>Apart from such sector-wide events, there are other key-events that may relate to just one company, and not the whole sector.

The inverse of this isn't always true - there can be circumstances which affect the stock price of a company even if there's no effect on its core operations or financials.</p> <p>Generally, this happens in instances where there can be supply overheads in the market for a company's share. An excess of supply of shares relative to demand can drive down a company's stock price.</p> <p>For example, a pledge of shares held by promoters of the company for a loan would hurt the market sentiments towards the company. This is because it's an additional market risk - if the promoters are unable to service their debt obligations, the lender can sell the shares taken as collateral, resulting in supply overhead of the company's shares in the market.</p> <p>Another example of this is when investors with high shareholding in a company decide to exit their investment. Again, this would possibly mean that there may be a supply overhead. Sometimes, even the market's perception that something like this may happen, results in a feedback loop - investors think a supply overhead may come from a large investor exiting a stock investment, and exit themselves, collectively creating a supply overhead.</p>"},{"location":"stocks/under-progress/understanding-the-business-of-a-company/#value-proposition-of-the-companys-products","title":"Value proposition of the company's products","text":"<p>This refers to the value addition by a company in its products.
